L@@ ast year I show@@ ed these two sli@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice cap@@ , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the low@@ er 4@@ 8 stat@@ es, has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent@@ .
But this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice.
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is, in a sen@@ se, the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system.
It exp@@ ands in w@@ int@@ er and contr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The next sli@@ de I show you will be a rapi@@ d fast@@ -@@ for@@ ward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in re@@ d.
As you see, it exp@@ ands to the dar@@ k bl@@ ue --
that's the ann@@ ual ice in w@@ inter@@ , and it contr@@ ac@@ ts in sum@@ mer@@ .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice, five years old or ol@@ der@@ , you can see is almost like bloo@@ d, spi@@ lling out of the body here.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
This is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ at@@ s up the fro@@ z@@ en ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an, where there is a mas@@ sive amount of fro@@ z@@ en carb@@ on wh@@ ich@@ , when it th@@ aw@@ s, is turned into me@@ th@@ ane by micro@@ b@@ es.
Com@@ par@@ ed to the tot@@ al amount of global war@@ ming poll@@ u@@ tion in the atmo@@ sp@@ here, that amount could dou@@ ble if we cro@@ ss this ti@@ pp@@ ing point@@ .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in A@@ las@@ k@@ a, me@@ th@@ ane is ac@@ tiv@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the wat@@ er.
Pro@@ f@@ esso@@ r K@@ at@@ ey W@@ alt@@ er from the Univers@@ ity of A@@ las@@ k@@ a went out with another team to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last w@@ inter@@ .
V@@ ide@@ o: Wh@@ o@@ a@@ ! Al G@@ or@@ e: S@@ he's o@@ ka@@ y. The question is whether we will b@@ e.
And one reason is, this enor@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th.
This is an ann@@ ual m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver@@ .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much larg@@ er than ever@@ .
This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ land@@ .
If you want to know how se@@ a level ri@@ ses from land@@ -@@ base ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a.
These flow@@ s are increas@@ ing very rapid@@ ly.
At the other end of the plan@@ et, An@@ tar@@ c@@ t@@ ica the larg@@ est mas@@ s of ice on the plan@@ et.
L@@ ast mon@@ th scientist@@ s re@@ port@@ ed the entire contin@@ ent is now in neg@@ ative ice bal@@ ance. And w@@ est An@@ tar@@ c@@ t@@ ica cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ land@@ s, is particul@@ arly rapi@@ d in its m@@ el@@ t@@ ing.
That's equ@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of se@@ a level@@ , as is Gre@@ en@@ land@@ .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as, the third larg@@ est mas@@ s of ic@@ e: at the top you see new la@@ k@@ es, which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers.
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their d@@ rin@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ ting flow@@ .
In the An@@ de@@ s, this gl@@ aci@@ er is the source of d@@ rin@@ king water for this cit@@ y.
The flow@@ s have increas@@ ed.
But when they go a@@ way, so does much of the d@@ rin@@ king wat@@ er.
In Californi@@ a there has been a 40 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the Si@@ erra s@@ now@@ pac@@ k.
This is h@@ it@@ ting the re@@ ser@@ vo@@ ir@@ s.
And the predic@@ tion@@ s, as you've read@@ , are seri@@ ous.
This d@@ r@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a d@@ ram@@ atic incre@@ ase in fi@@ re@@ s.
And the disa@@ st@@ ers around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extra@@ ordin@@ ary and un@@ preced@@ ent@@ ed rat@@ e.
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5@@ .
This is a completely un@@ sustain@@ able patter@@ n.
If you look at in the cont@@ ex@@ t of history you can see what this is do@@ ing.
In the last five years we've ad@@ ded 70 million t@@ ons of CO@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 hours -- 25 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ an@@ s.
Lo@@ ok care@@ fully at the area of the e@@ ast@@ er@@ n P@@ aci@@ fic@@ , from the Americ@@ as, ext@@ ending w@@ est@@ war@@ d, and on ei@@ ther side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent, where there is a radic@@ al de@@ pl@@ et@@ ion of ox@@ y@@ g@@ en in the oce@@ an@@ s.
The bigg@@ est single cause of global war@@ m@@ ing, along with de@@ forest@@ ation, which is 20 percent of it, is the bur@@ ning of fossi@@ l fu@@ el@@ s.
O@@ il is a problem@@ , and co@@ al is the most seri@@ ous problem.
The United St@@ ates is one of the two larg@@ est em@@ it@@ ter@@ s, along with Ch@@ ina.
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al plant@@ s.
But we're beginning to see a se@@ a chang@@ e.
Here are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en altern@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ po@@ se@@ d.
H@@ ow@@ ever there is a political batt@@ le in our countr@@ y.
And the co@@ al industri@@ es and the o@@ il industri@@ es spent a qu@@ art@@ er of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mo@@ ting cle@@ an co@@ al, which is an ox@@ y@@ mor@@ on.
That im@@ age re@@ min@@ ded me of some@@ thing.
A@@ ro@@ und Chri@@ st@@ mas@@ , in my home in T@@ en@@ nes@@ see, a billion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ d@@ ge was spi@@ ll@@ ed.
You probably saw it on the new@@ s.
Th@@ is, all over the countr@@ y, is the second larg@@ est wa@@ ste stre@@ am in Amer@@ ica.
This happened around Chri@@ st@@ mas@@ .
One of the co@@ al industr@@ y's ad@@ s around Chri@@ st@@ m@@ as was this one.
V@@ ide@@ o: ♪@@ ♫ F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is a jo@@ ll@@ y, happy s@@ oul@@ .
He's ab@@ und@@ ant here in Amer@@ ica, and he hel@@ ps our econom@@ y grow@@ .
F@@ ro@@ st@@ y the co@@ al man is getting cle@@ an@@ er every@@ day.
He's af@@ for@@ d@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able, and work@@ ers keep their pa@@ y.
Al G@@ or@@ e: This is the source of much of the co@@ al in W@@ est V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a.
The larg@@ est mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ as@@ se@@ y Co@@ al.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ on B@@ lan@@ k@@ en@@ shi@@ p@@ : Let me be cle@@ ar about it. Al G@@ ore, N@@ anc@@ y Pe@@ lo@@ si, Har@@ ry R@@ ei@@ d, they don't know what they're talking ab@@ out.
Al G@@ or@@ e: So the All@@ i@@ ance for C@@ lim@@ ate Pro@@ tec@@ tion has la@@ un@@ ched two cam@@ pa@@ ign@@ s.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
V@@ ide@@ o: Ac@@ tor@@ : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ er@@ gy we view climate change as a very seri@@ ous thre@@ at to our busin@@ ess.
That's why we've made it our pri@@ mar@@ y go@@ al to spend a large su@@ m of money on an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing ef@@ for@@ t to help bring out and complic@@ ate the tr@@ ut@@ h about co@@ al.
The fact is, co@@ al isn't dir@@ t@@ y.
We think it's cle@@ an -- sm@@ ell@@ s go@@ od, to@@ o.
So don't wor@@ ry about climate chang@@ e.
Le@@ ave that up to us.
V@@ ide@@ o: Ac@@ tor@@ : C@@ le@@ an co@@ al -- you've heard a lot about it.
So let's take a t@@ our of this stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art cle@@ an co@@ al facil@@ ity.
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ! The mach@@ in@@ er@@ y is kind of l@@ ou@@ d. But that's the sound of cle@@ an co@@ al technolog@@ y.
And while bur@@ ning co@@ al is one of the lead@@ ing caus@@ es of global war@@ m@@ ing, the re@@ mark@@ able cle@@ an co@@ al technology you see here chang@@ es every@@ thing.
T@@ ake a good long loo@@ k@@ : this is to@@ da@@ y's cle@@ an co@@ al technolog@@ y.
Al G@@ or@@ e: F@@ in@@ ally, the positi@@ ve altern@@ ative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic chall@@ en@@ ge and our national se@@ cur@@ ity challeng@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or@@ : America is in cri@@ si@@ s -- the econom@@ y, national se@@ cur@@ ity, the climate cri@@ si@@ s.
The thre@@ ad that lin@@ ks them all@@ : our ad@@ dic@@ tion to carb@@ on based fu@@ el@@ s, like dir@@ ty co@@ al and for@@ e@@ ign o@@ il@@ .
But now there is a b@@ old new solu@@ tion to get us out of this m@@ ess.
Re@@ power America with 100 percent cle@@ an electr@@ ic@@ ity within 10 years.
A pl@@ an to put America back to work, make us more se@@ cu@@ re, and help stop global war@@ m@@ ing.
F@@ in@@ ally, a solu@@ tion that's big enough to solve our problem@@ s.
Re@@ power Amer@@ ica. F@@ ind out more.
Al G@@ or@@ e: This is the last one.
V@@ ide@@ o: N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or@@ : It's about re@@ power@@ ing Amer@@ ica.
One of the fast@@ est ways to c@@ ut our depen@@ d@@ ence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ el@@ s that are kill@@ ing our plan@@ et.
Man@@ : F@@ ut@@ ure@@ 's over here. W@@ in@@ d, sun@@ , a new energy gri@@ d.
M@@ an #@@ 2@@ : New invest@@ ments to create high@@ -@@ pa@@ ying job@@ s.
N@@ ar@@ rat@@ or@@ : Re@@ power Amer@@ ica. It's time to get re@@ al.
Al G@@ or@@ e: There is an old Afric@@ an pro@@ ver@@ b that says, "@@ If you want to go quick@@ ly, go al@@ one.
If you want to go far@@ , go toge@@ ther@@ ."
We need to go far@@ , quick@@ ly.
Thank you very much.
L@@ ast year at TED I gave an intro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
And I pro@@ mi@@ sed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that mach@@ ine work@@ ed.
So this is it. And for those of you that w@@ er@@ en't there, the L@@ H@@ C is the larg@@ est scienti@@ fic exper@@ im@@ ent ever att@@ em@@ pt@@ ed -- 2@@ 7 ki@@ lo@@ met@@ ers in circu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence.
It@@ s job is to re@@ create the condit@@ ions that were present less than a bill@@ ion@@ th of a second after the universe beg@@ an, up to 6@@ 00 million times a secon@@ d.
It's nothing if not amb@@ iti@@ ous.
This is the mach@@ ine be@@ low G@@ en@@ ev@@ a.
We take the pictu@@ res of those mini@@ -@@ Bi@@ g B@@ ang@@ s inside de@@ tec@@ tor@@ s.
This is the one I work on. It's called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ tec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 met@@ ers w@@ ide@@ , 2@@ 2 met@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er.
S@@ p@@ ect@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale.
On the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the mach@@ ine on for the first time.
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S.
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se celebr@@ ation in the control room@@ .
It's a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C@@ , coll@@ id@@ ing with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C de@@ liber@@ at@@ ely, and show@@ ering partic@@ les into the de@@ tec@@ tor@@ .
In other wor@@ ds, when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we knew the mach@@ ine work@@ ed, which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph@@ .
I don't know whether this got the bigg@@ est che@@ er, or this, when someone went on@@ to Google and saw the front p@@ age was like that.
It means we made cultu@@ ral imp@@ act as well as scienti@@ fic imp@@ ac@@ t.
A@@ b@@ out a wee@@ k lat@@ er we had a problem with the mach@@ ine, rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these g@@ old wi@@ re@@ s.
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thous@@ and amp@@ s when the mach@@ ine is working in full pow@@ er.
Now the engine@@ ers am@@ on@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say, "@@ No they don@@ '@@ t. They're small wi@@ re@@ s."
They can do that because when they are very co@@ ld they are what's called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re.
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degre@@ es, col@@ der than the space between the star@@ s, those wi@@ res can take that curr@@ ent.
In one of the jo@@ int@@ s between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ net@@ s in L@@ H@@ C@@ , there was a manu@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ec@@ t.
So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up sli@@ ght@@ ly, and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 amp@@ s sud@@ den@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed electr@@ ical resist@@ ance.
This was the resul@@ t.
Now that's more im@@ pressi@@ ve when you consi@@ der those mag@@ net@@ s we@@ i@@ gh over 20 ton@@ s, and they mov@@ ed about a foot@@ .
So we dam@@ ag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ net@@ s.
We had to take them out, which we di@@ d.
We re@@ condit@@ ion@@ ed them all, fi@@ x@@ ed them.
They're all on their way back under@@ ground now.
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ act again.
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on, and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ ul@@ y, and continu@@ e with our qu@@ est to find out what the building bloc@@ ks of the universe are.
Now of course, in a way those acci@@ dent@@ s re@@ ign@@ ite the deb@@ ate about the val@@ ue of science and engine@@ ering at the ed@@ g@@ e. It's easy to re@@ fut@@ e.
I think that the fact that it's so difficul@@ t, the fact that we're over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing, is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C@@ .
I will leave the fin@@ al word to an Engli@@ sh scientist@@ , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y Dav@@ y, wh@@ o, I s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t, when de@@ f@@ ending his prote@@ ge@@ 's us@@ el@@ ess experiment@@ s -- his prote@@ ge was M@@ ich@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay -- said this, "@@ No@@ thing is so dang@@ er@@ ous to the progre@@ ss of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our view@@ s of science are ulti@@ mat@@ e, that there are no my@@ st@@ eri@@ es in natu@@ re, that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complet@@ e, and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er@@ ."
Thank you.
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a ki@@ d, pla@@ ying with bloc@@ ks.
As you figu@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ asp@@ , pic@@ k them up and move them aro@@ und, you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s.
S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ e@@ ply connec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
So, as a computer scienti@@ st inspi@@ red by this uti@@ lit@@ y of our interac@@ tions with physical objec@@ ts -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ atti@@ e, and my collabor@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to won@@ der -- what if when we used a comput@@ er, instead of having this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ so@@ r that was a like a digit@@ al f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ to@@ p, what if we could re@@ ach in with both hand@@ s and gr@@ as@@ p information physic@@ ally,
ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it the way we want@@ ed@@ ?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we decided to expl@@ ore the answ@@ er, by building Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ l@@ es.
In a nut@@ sh@@ ell, a Si@@ ft@@ able is an interac@@ tive computer
the size of a co@@ o@@ ki@@ e.
They're able to be mov@@ ed around by hand@@ , they can sense each other@@ , they can sense their mo@@ tion, and they have a scre@@ en and a wi@@ rel@@ ess radi@@ o.
Mo@@ st important@@ ly, they're physic@@ al, so like the bloc@@ ks, you can move them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ asp@@ ing.
And Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem of tool@@ s for mani@@ pul@@ ating digit@@ al inform@@ ation.
And as these tool@@ s become more physic@@ al, more aw@@ are of their mo@@ tion, aw@@ are of each other@@ , and aw@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we move them, we can start to expl@@ ore some new and f@@ un interac@@ tion st@@ y@@ l@@ es.
So, I'm going to start with some simple exampl@@ es.
This Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ figu@@ red to show vide@@ o, and if I ti@@ l@@ t it in one direc@@ tion, it@@ 'll ro@@ ll the video this wa@@ y@@ ; if I ti@@ l@@ t it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it back@@ war@@ ds.
And these interac@@ tive port@@ ra@@ its are aw@@ are of each other.
So if I put them next to each other@@ , they get interest@@ ed.
If they get sur@@ ro@@ un@@ de@@ d, they not@@ ice that to@@ o,
they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed.
And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and ti@@ l@@ t.
One of the interesting im@@ plic@@ ations on interac@@ tion, we started to reali@@ z@@ e, was that we could use every@@ day gest@@ u@@ res on dat@@ a, like p@@ our@@ ing a colo@@ r the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qui@@ d.
So in this cas@@ e, we've got three Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les con@@ figu@@ red to be pa@@ int b@@ uc@@ k@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our colo@@ r into that cent@@ ral one,
where they get mi@@ x@@ ed.
If we over@@ sho@@ ot@@ , we can p@@ our a little bit bac@@ k.
There are also some ne@@ at possibilit@@ ies for educ@@ ation, like langu@@ age, mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c gam@@ es where we want to give people the ability to try things quick@@ ly, and view the resul@@ ts immediat@@ el@@ y.
So here I'm --
This is a Fi@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ ci sequ@@ ence that I'm making with a simple equ@@ ation program@@ .
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ cra@@ b@@ ble and B@@ ogg@@ le.
B@@ as@@ ic@@ ally, in every ro@@ und you get a ran@@ do@@ m@@ ly as@@ sign@@ ed l@@ etter on each Si@@ ft@@ able, and as you try to make words it ch@@ ec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ar@@ y.
Th@@ en, after about 30 secon@@ ds, it re@@ sh@@ uff@@ l@@ es, and you have a new set of letter@@ s and new possibilit@@ ies to tr@@ y.
Thank you.
So these are some kids that came on a fiel@@ d tri@@ p to the M@@ edi@@ a L@@ ab@@ , and I manag@@ ed to get them to try it out, and sho@@ ot a vide@@ o.
They really lo@@ ved it.
An@@ d, one of the interesting things about this kind of applic@@ ation is that you don't have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tion@@ s.
All you have to say is, "@@ Ma@@ ke wor@@ d@@ s@@ ," and they know exactly what to do.
So here's another few people trying it out.
That's our youn@@ g@@ est bet@@ a test@@ er, down there on the right.
T@@ ur@@ ns out, all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les up.
So to him@@ , they were just bloc@@ ks.
Now, this is an interac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on applic@@ ation.
And we wanted to build a learning to@@ ol for language lear@@ ner@@ s. And this is F@@ eli@@ x, actu@@ ally.
And he can bring new char@@ ac@@ ters into the scen@@ e,
just by lif@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that char@@ act@@ er sh@@ own on them.
H@@ ere, he's br@@ ing@@ ing the s@@ un out.
V@@ ide@@ o: The s@@ un is ris@@ ing.
David M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ : Now he's brought a tr@@ act@@ or into the scen@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: The or@@ ange trac@@ tor@@ .
Go@@ od job@@ ! Ye@@ ah@@ !
D@@ M: So by sh@@ a@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les and put@@ ting them next to each other he can make the char@@ ac@@ ters inter@@ act --
V@@ ide@@ o: W@@ o@@ of@@ !
D@@ M: invent@@ ing his own nar@@ r@@ ativ@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: H@@ ell@@ o@@ !
D@@ M: It's an open@@ -@@ en@@ ded stor@@ y,
and he gets to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds.
V@@ ide@@ o: F@@ ly a@@ way, cat@@ .
D@@ M: So, the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ enc@@ ing and live performan@@ ce to@@ ol
that we've built recent@@ ly,
in which Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les act as so@@ unds like lead@@ , bas@@ s and d@@ r@@ um@@ s.
E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ ations, you get to cho@@ ose which one you want to us@@ e.
And you can in@@ jec@@ t these so@@ unds into a sequ@@ ence that you can as@@ sem@@ ble into the patter@@ n that you want@@ .
And you in@@ jec@@ t it by just b@@ um@@ ping up the sound Si@@ ft@@ able against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ able.
There are effec@@ ts that you can control liv@@ e, like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter.
You att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then ti@@ l@@ t to ad@@ just it.
And then, over@@ all effec@@ ts like tempo and volu@@ me that ap@@ ply to the entire sequ@@ ence.
So let's have a loo@@ k.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: We@@ 'll start by put@@ ting a le@@ ad into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ l@@ es, ar@@ r@@ ange them into a seri@@ es, ex@@ ten@@ d it, ad@@ d a little more lead@@ .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: Now I'll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the d@@ r@@ um@@ s, so I can control the eff@@ ect liv@@ e.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: I can spe@@ ed up the whole sequ@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tempo one way or the other.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: And now I'll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ pressi@@ on.
V@@ ide@@ o: D@@ M: I can re@@ ar@@ r@@ ange the sequ@@ ence while it play@@ s.
So I don't have to pl@@ an it out in adv@@ ance, but I can im@@ provi@@ se, making it longer or sh@@ ort@@ er as I go.
And now, fin@@ ally, I can f@@ ade the whole sequ@@ ence out using the volu@@ me Si@@ ft@@ able, ti@@ l@@ ted to the le@@ f@@ t.
Thank you.
So, as you can see, my pas@@ sion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ di@@ es work.
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design spac@@ e, and a few of the possibilit@@ ies that we're working to bring out of the labor@@ ator@@ y.
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we're on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of tool@@ s for interac@@ ting with digit@@ al media that are going to bring information into our world on our ter@@ m@@ s.
Thank you very much.
I look for@@ ward to talking with all of you.
I am a writ@@ er.
W@@ rit@@ ing boo@@ ks is my prof@@ essi@@ on but it's more than that, of cour@@ se.
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and f@@ ascin@@ ation.
And I don't exp@@ ect that that's ever going to chang@@ e.
B@@ ut, that said, something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened recent@@ ly in my life and in my care@@ er, which has ca@@ used me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relation@@ ship with this work.
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I recent@@ ly wro@@ te this boo@@ k, this mem@@ o@@ ir called "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ ov@@ e" wh@@ ich@@ , deci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous boo@@ ks, went out in the world for some reas@@ on, and became this bi@@ g, me@@ ga@@ -@@ sens@@ ation, intern@@ ational b@@ est@@ se@@ ll@@ er thing.
The resul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go now, people tre@@ at me like I'm do@@ om@@ ed.
S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed, do@@ om@@ ed@@ !
Li@@ k@@ e, they come up to me now, all wor@@ ri@@ ed, and they say, "A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to be able to top that?
A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ id you're going to keep writ@@ ing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all,
ever again@@ ?"
So that's reas@@ sur@@ ing, you know.
But it would be wor@@ se, ex@@ ce@@ pt for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er, when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writ@@ er,
I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based re@@ ac@@ tion.
And people would say, "A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ id you're never going to have any success@@ ?
A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ id the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will k@@ ill you@@ ?
A@@ ren@@ 't you af@@ ra@@ id that you're going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and no@@ thing@@ 's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ outh fi@@ ll@@ ed with bit@@ ter as@@ h of fail@@ ure@@ ?"
Li@@ ke that, you know.
The answer -- the sh@@ ort answer to all those questions is, "@@ Y@@ es@@ ."
Y@@ es, I'm af@@ ra@@ id of all those things.
And I always have be@@ en.
And I'm af@@ ra@@ id of man@@ y, many more things b@@ es@@ ide@@ s that people can't even gu@@ ess at,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are scar@@ y.
B@@ ut, when it comes to writ@@ ing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lat@@ ely, and wonder@@ ing about lat@@ ely, is wh@@ y?
You know, is it r@@ ation@@ al@@ ?
Is it log@@ ical that any@@ body should be exp@@ ected to be af@@ ra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it speci@@ fic@@ ally about cre@@ ative vent@@ u@@ res that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other@@ 's mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don't do, you know@@ ?
Li@@ ke my d@@ ad, for example, was a chem@@ ical engine@@ er and I don't re@@ call once in his 40 years of chem@@ ical engine@@ ering any@@ body as@@ king him if he was af@@ ra@@ id to be a chem@@ ical engine@@ er, you know@@ ?
"@@ That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engine@@ ering bloc@@ k, Joh@@ n, h@@ ow@@ 's it go@@ ing@@ ?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know@@ ?
But to be f@@ air@@ , chem@@ ical engine@@ ers as a group hav@@ en't really ear@@ ned a re@@ put@@ ation over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ hol@@ ic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pressi@@ v@@ es.
We writ@@ ers, we kind of do have that re@@ put@@ ation, and not just writ@@ ers, but cre@@ ative people across all gen@@ re@@ s, it seem@@ s, have this re@@ put@@ ation for being enor@@ m@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able.
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m de@@ ath coun@@ t in the 20@@ th centur@@ y al@@ one, of really mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed young and often at their own hand@@ s, you know@@ ?
And even the ones who didn't liter@@ ally com@@ mi@@ t su@@ ici@@ de see@@ m to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ ft@@ s, you know.
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er, just before he di@@ ed, last inter@@ view@@ , he said, "@@ E@@ very one of my boo@@ ks has kill@@ ed me a little mor@@ e." A@@ n extra@@ ordin@@ ary stat@@ ement to make about your lif@@ e's work.
But we don't even bl@@ in@@ k when we hear somebody say this, because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and some@@ how we've completely intern@@ ali@@ zed and acc@@ e@@ pt@@ ed collec@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that creati@@ vit@@ y and suff@@ ering are some@@ how in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y, in the en@@ d, will always ulti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ i@@ sh@@ .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all co@@ ol with that ide@@ a?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that? Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and, you know -- I'm not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that as@@ sum@@ pt@@ ion.
I think it's o@@ di@@ ous.
And I also think it's dang@@ er@@ ous, and I don't want to see it per@@ pet@@ u@@ ated into the next centur@@ y.
I think it's better if we en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to liv@@ e.
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that, in my case -- in my situ@@ ation -- it would be very dang@@ er@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dar@@ k pat@@ h of as@@ sum@@ pt@@ ion, particul@@ arly given the circu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that I'm in right now in my care@@ er.
Wh@@ ich is -- you know, like ch@@ ec@@ k it out, I'm pretty youn@@ g, I'm only about 40 years ol@@ d.
I still have maybe another four deca@@ des of work left in me.
And it's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly likely that anything I write from this point for@@ ward is going to be ju@@ dg@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess of my last boo@@ k, right?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly likely that my great@@ est succ@@ ess is behind me.
So J@@ es@@ us, what a thou@@ ght@@ !
That's the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start d@@ rin@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o@@ '@@ c@@ loc@@ k in the mor@@ n@@ ing, and I don't want to go there.
I would pre@@ f@@ er to keep doing this work that I lo@@ ve.
And so, the question be@@ com@@ es, h@@ ow@@ ?
And so, it seems to me, u@@ po@@ n a lot of re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tion, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continu@@ e writ@@ ing, is that I have to create some sort of protec@@ tive psy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ struc@@ t, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe dist@@ ance between me, as I am writ@@ ing, and my very natural an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that writ@@ ing is going to be, from now on. An@@ d, as I've been loo@@ king, over the last year, for model@@ s for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societ@@ ies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have
about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emot@@ ional ris@@ ks of creati@@ vit@@ y.
And that se@@ arch has led me to anci@@ ent Gre@@ ece and anci@@ ent R@@ om@@ e.
So sta@@ y with me, because it does cir@@ cle around and bac@@ k.
B@@ ut, anci@@ ent Gre@@ ece and anci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that creati@@ vit@@ y came from human be@@ ings back then, OK@@ ?
People believ@@ ed that creati@@ vit@@ y was this di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ t that came to human be@@ ings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able sourc@@ e, for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reas@@ on@@ s.
The Gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ rit@@ s of creati@@ vit@@ y "@@ da@@ em@@ on@@ s."
S@@ oc@@ rat@@ es, fam@@ ous@@ ly, believ@@ ed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke w@@ is@@ dom to him from a@@ far@@ .
The Ro@@ man@@ s had the same idea, but they called that sort of di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative spi@@ ri@@ t a gen@@ i@@ us.
Wh@@ ich is great@@ , because the Ro@@ man@@ s did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a particul@@ arly cl@@ ever individu@@ al.
They believ@@ ed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this, sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity, who was believ@@ ed to liter@@ ally live in the w@@ all@@ s of an artist@@ 's studi@@ o, kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f@@ , and who would come out and sort of in@@ visi@@ bly assi@@ st the arti@@ st with their work and would shap@@ e the out@@ come of that work.
So brill@@ i@@ ant -- there it is, right there, that dist@@ ance that I'm talking about -- that psy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ struc@@ t to protec@@ t you from the resul@@ ts of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed, right?
So the anci@@ ent arti@@ st was protec@@ ted from certain things, like, for example, too much nar@@ ci@@ ssi@@ sm@@ , right?
If your work was brill@@ i@@ ant@@ , you couldn't take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it, everybody knew that you had this di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ ped you.
If your work bo@@ mb@@ ed, not enti@@ re@@ ly your fa@@ ul@@ t, you know@@ ?
Every@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of lam@@ e.
And this is how people thought about creati@@ vit@@ y in the W@@ est for a really long time.
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything chang@@ ed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was, let's put the individu@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the universe ab@@ ove all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es, and there's no more room for my@@ st@@ ical cre@@ atu@@ res who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ vin@@ e.
And it's the beginning of r@@ ational human@@ is@@ m, and people started to believe that creati@@ vit@@ y came completely from the self of the individu@@ al.
And for the first time in histor@@ y, you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us, rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us.
And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge err@@ or.
You know, I think that allow@@ ing some@@ bod@@ y, one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like, the v@@ es@@ sel@@ , you know, like the fon@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the source of all di@@ vin@@ e, cre@@ ativ@@ e, un@@ know@@ able, eter@@ n@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ d@@ ge too much responsi@@ bilit@@ y to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le, human psy@@ ch@@ e.
It's like as@@ king somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun@@ .
It just completely war@@ ps and dist@@ ort@@ s e@@ go@@ s, and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ manag@@ e@@ able exp@@ ect@@ ations about performan@@ ce.
And I think the pres@@ sure of that has been kill@@ ing off our artist@@ s for the last 500 years.
An@@ d, if this is tru@@ e, and I think it is tru@@ e, the question be@@ com@@ es, what now@@ ?
Can we do this differ@@ ent@@ l@@ y?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more anci@@ ent understanding about the relation@@ ship between human@@ s and the cre@@ ative my@@ ster@@ y.
Ma@@ ybe no@@ t.
Ma@@ ybe we can't just er@@ ase 500 years of r@@ ational human@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 18 min@@ ute spe@@ e@@ ch.
And there's probably people in this audi@@ ence who would rai@@ se really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scienti@@ fic s@@ us@@ pic@@ ions about the no@@ tion of@@ , bas@@ ic@@ ally, f@@ ai@@ ri@@ es who foll@@ ow people around ru@@ bb@@ ing f@@ air@@ y ju@@ ice on their projec@@ ts and stuff@@ .
I'm no@@ t, prob@@ ab@@ ly, going to bring you all along with me on this.
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not@@ ?
Why not think about it this wa@@ y?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expl@@ ain@@ ing the utt@@ er mad@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ric@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of the cre@@ ative proc@@ ess.
A process wh@@ ich@@ , as any@@ body who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- know@@ s does not always be@@ have r@@ ation@@ ally.
An@@ d, in fact, can sometimes feel dow@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal@@ .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter recent@@ ly where I met the extra@@ ordin@@ ary American po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h St@@ one, who's now in her 9@@ 0@@ s, but sh@@ e's been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in ru@@ ral V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a, she would be out working in the fiel@@ ds, and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ e@@ m coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air@@ .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e.
And she felt it com@@ ing, because it would sh@@ ake the ear@@ th under her fe@@ et.
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point@@ , and that was to, in her wor@@ ds, "@@ run like h@@ ell@@ ."
And she would run like h@@ ell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em@@ , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of pa@@ per and a pen@@ ci@@ l f@@ ast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her@@ , she could coll@@ ect it and gra@@ b it on the pag@@ e.
And other times she wouldn't be f@@ ast enou@@ gh, so she@@ 'd be run@@ ning and run@@ n@@ ing, and she wouldn't get to the house and the po@@ e@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mi@@ ss it and she said it would continu@@ e on across the land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, loo@@ king, as she put it "@@ for another po@@ et@@ ."
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were moment@@ s where she would almost mi@@ ss it, right?
So, sh@@ e's run@@ ning to the house and sh@@ e's looking for the pa@@ per and the po@@ e@@ m pas@@ ses through her@@ , and she gra@@ b@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it's going through her@@ , and then she said, it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it.
She would cat@@ ch the po@@ e@@ m by its tail@@ , and she would pul@@ l it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the pag@@ e.
And in these inst@@ anc@@ es, the po@@ e@@ m would come up on the p@@ age perf@@ ect and int@@ act but back@@ war@@ ds, from the last word to the fir@@ st.
So when I heard that I was like -- that's un@@ c@@ ann@@ y, that's exactly what my cre@@ ative process is lik@@ e.
That's not at all what my cre@@ ative process is -- I'm not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine@@ !
I'm a mul@@ e, and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day, and s@@ we@@ at and lab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly.
But even I@@ , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ nes@@ s, even I have br@@ ush@@ ed up against that thing, at tim@@ es.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have to@@ o.
You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identi@@ f@@ y.
And what is that thing@@ ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lo@@ se our min@@ ds, b@@ ut, in fact, might actually keep us san@@ e?
And for me, the best cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ it@@ s, who I got to inter@@ view sever@@ al years ago on a mag@@ az@@ ine as@@ sign@@ ment.
And we were talking about this, and you know, T@@ om@@ , for most of his life, he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary moder@@ n arti@@ st, trying to control and man@@ age and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able cre@@ ative im@@ pul@@ ses that were tot@@ ally intern@@ aliz@@ ed.
But then he got ol@@ der@@ , he got cal@@ mer@@ , and one day he was driv@@ ing down the free@@ way in Lo@@ s An@@ gel@@ es, and this is when it all changed for him@@ .
And he's spe@@ ed@@ ing al@@ on@@ g, and all of a sud@@ den he hear@@ s this little f@@ rag@@ ment of me@@ lo@@ d@@ y, that comes into his head as inspi@@ r@@ ation often com@@ es, el@@ u@@ sive and t@@ ant@@ aliz@@ ing, and he want@@ s it, it's g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous, and he long@@ s for it, but he has no way to get it.
He doesn't have a piece of pa@@ per@@ , or a pen@@ ci@@ l@@ , or a t@@ ap@@ e recor@@ der@@ .
So he start@@ s to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to ri@@ se in him like, "@@ I'm going to lo@@ se this thing, and I'll be be h@@ a@@ un@@ ted by this son@@ g for@@ ever@@ .
I'm not good enou@@ gh, and I can't do it@@ ."
And instead of pan@@ ick@@ ing, he just stop@@ p@@ ed.
He just stop@@ ped that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el@@ .
He just looked up at the sk@@ y, and he said, "@@ Ex@@ c@@ use me, can you not see that I'm driv@@ ing@@ ?"
"D@@ o I look like I can write down a son@@ g right now@@ ?
If you really want to exist@@ , come back at a more opportun@@ e moment when I can take care of you.
O@@ ther@@ w@@ is@@ e, go bo@@ ther somebody else today.
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard Co@@ h@@ en@@ ."
And his whole work process changed after that.
Not the work, the work was still oft@@ ent@@ imes as dar@@ k as ever@@ .
But the proc@@ ess, and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was re@@ le@@ as@@ ed when he took the gen@@ i@@ e, the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but tro@@ u@@ ble, and re@@ le@@ as@@ ed it back where it came fro@@ m, and realized that this didn't have to be this intern@@ aliz@@ ed, tor@@ ment@@ ed thing.
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar@@ , won@@ dro@@ us, bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re collabor@@ ation, kind of convers@@ ation between T@@ om and the str@@ ang@@ e, ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om@@ .
When I heard that stor@@ y, it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked to@@ o, and this idea already sav@@ ed me on@@ ce.
It sav@@ ed me when I was in the middle of writ@@ ing "@@ E@@ at, P@@ ra@@ y, L@@ ov@@ e@@ ," and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of de@@ sp@@ air that we all f@@ all into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disa@@ st@@ er, the wor@@ st book ever writ@@ ten@@ .
Not just b@@ ad, but the wor@@ st book ever writ@@ ten@@ .
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this projec@@ t.
But then I remem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the open air and I tried it.
So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I direc@@ ted my com@@ ments to an em@@ pt@@ y cor@@ ner of the room@@ .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d, "@@ L@@ ist@@ en you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brill@@ i@@ ant that is not enti@@ re@@ ly my fa@@ ul@@ t, right?
Because you can see that I am put@@ ting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.
If you want it to be bet@@ ter, you've got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al.
But if you don't do that, you know what@@ , the h@@ ell with it.
I'm going to keep writ@@ ing any@@ way because that's my job@@ .
And I would pl@@ e@@ ase like the recor@@ d to re@@ fl@@ ect today that I show@@ ed up for my part of the job@@ ." Because -- Because in the end it's like this, O@@ K -- cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ago in the de@@ ser@@ ts of N@@ orth Africa, people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ anc@@ es of sac@@ red d@@ ance and music that would go on for hours and hour@@ s, until da@@ w@@ n.
They were always mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent, because the d@@ an@@ cer@@ s were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic@@ , right?
But every once in a wh@@ il@@ e, very rar@@ ely, something would happen@@ , and one of these per@@ for@@ mer@@ s would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent.
And I know you know what I'm talking ab@@ out, because I know you've all se@@ en, at some point in your life, a performan@@ ce like this.
It was like time would stop@@ , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever don@@ e, 1@@ ,000 ni@@ ghts befor@@ e, but everything would ali@@ gn@@ .
And all of a su@@ dd@@ en, he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human@@ .
He would be li@@ t from wi@@ thin@@ , and li@@ t from be@@ low and all li@@ t up on fi@@ re with di@@ vin@@ ity.
And when this happen@@ ed, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its nam@@ e.
They would put their hand@@ s together and they would start to ch@@ ant@@ , "@@ All@@ ah, All@@ ah, All@@ ah, Go@@ d, Go@@ d, Go@@ d@@ ."
That's Go@@ d, you know.
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous histor@@ ical foot@@ no@@ te@@ : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ a@@ ded s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es from "@@ All@@ ah, All@@ ah, All@@ ah@@ ," to "O@@ l@@ é, ol@@ é, ol@@ é@@ ," which you still hear in bu@@ ll@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o d@@ anc@@ es.
In S@@ pa@@ in, when a per@@ form@@ er has done something im@@ possible and mag@@ ic, "@@ All@@ ah, ol@@ é, ol@@ é, All@@ ah, mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent, br@@ av@@ o@@ ," in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble, there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of Go@@ d.
Wh@@ ich is great@@ , because we need that.
B@@ ut, the tr@@ ick@@ y bit comes the next mor@@ n@@ ing, for the d@@ anc@@ er him@@ self, when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it's T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ , and he's no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of Go@@ d.
He's just an ag@@ ing mort@@ al with really bad k@@ ne@@ es, and maybe he's never going to asc@@ end to that he@@ ight again.
And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant Go@@ d@@ 's name again as he sp@@ in@@ s, and what is he then to do with the rest of his li@@ fe@@ ?
This is har@@ d.
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believ@@ e, in the first plac@@ e, that the most extra@@ ordin@@ ary asp@@ ec@@ ts of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just believ@@ ed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imag@@ in@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be pass@@ ed along when you're fini@@ sh@@ ed, with somebody el@@ se.
An@@ d, you know, if we think about it this way, it start@@ s to change every@@ thing.
This is how I've started to think, and this is certa@@ inly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will so@@ on be publi@@ sh@@ ed, as the dang@@ er@@ ous@@ ly, fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly over@@ -@@ ant@@ icip@@ ated foll@@ ow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish succ@@ ess.
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that is don't be af@@ rai@@ d.
Don@@ 't be da@@ un@@ t@@ ed. Just do your job@@ .
Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might b@@ e.
If your job is to d@@ ance, do your d@@ ance.
If the di@@ vin@@ e, co@@ c@@ k@@ ey@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us as@@ sign@@ ed to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ se@@ d, for just one moment through your ef@@ fort@@ s, then "O@@ l@@ é@@ !"
And if no@@ t, do your d@@ ance any@@ h@@ ow@@ .
And "O@@ l@@ é@@ !" to you, non@@ e@@ the@@ les@@ s.
I believe this and I feel that we must te@@ ach it.
"O@@ l@@ é@@ !" to you, non@@ e@@ the@@ les@@ s, just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep show@@ ing up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
J@@ un@@ e Co@@ h@@ en@@ : O@@ l@@ é@@ !
You know, I've talked about some of these projec@@ ts before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean, and discover@@ ing new s@@ ets of gen@@ es.
We're actually starting at a new point@@ : we've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing biolog@@ y, and now we're trying to go from that digit@@ al co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of biolog@@ y with design@@ ing and sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ z@@ ing life.
So, we've always been trying to ask big question@@ s.
"@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?" is something that I think many bi@@ ologi@@ sts have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous level@@ s.
We've tried vari@@ ous appro@@ ach@@ es, par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al compon@@ ent@@ s.
We've been dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing it now for almost 20 year@@ s@@ ;
when we sequ@@ enc@@ ed the human gen@@ om@@ e, it was going from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biolog@@ y into the digit@@ al world of the comput@@ er.
Now we're trying to as@@ k, "@@ Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digit@@ al univer@@ se@@ ?"
This is the ma@@ p of a small organis@@ m, M@@ y@@ co@@ pl@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um@@ , that has the small@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ re@@ plic@@ ate in the labor@@ ator@@ y,
and we've been trying to just see if we can come up with an even small@@ er gen@@ om@@ e.
We're able to kno@@ c@@ k out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here.
When we look at its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic m@@ ap@@ , it's rel@@ ativ@@ ely simple compar@@ ed to our@@ s --
tr@@ ust me, this is simple --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ c@@ k out one at a time, it's very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a living cell@@ .
So we decided the only way for@@ ward was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ ze this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundament@@ al question@@ s.
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of@@ : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ ze a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
Can chem@@ i@@ str@@ y per@@ mi@@ t making these really large molec@@ ul@@ es where we've never been befor@@ e?
And if we do, can we boo@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ so@@ me, by the way, is just a piece of in@@ er@@ t chem@@ ical materi@@ al.
So, our p@@ ace of dig@@ iti@@ z@@ ing life has been increas@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ ential pac@@ e.
Our ability to write the genet@@ ic co@@ de has been moving pretty s@@ low@@ ly but has been increas@@ ing,
and our lat@@ est point would put it on, now, an exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ve.
We started this over 15 years ago.
It took sever@@ al st@@ ag@@ es, in fact, starting with a bio@@ e@@ th@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiment@@ s.
But it turns out sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ z@@ ing DNA is very difficul@@ t.
There are ten@@ s of thousands of mach@@ ines around the world that make small piec@@ es of DNA -- 30 to 50 letter@@ s in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it's a de@@ gener@@ ate proc@@ ess, so the longer you make the piec@@ e, the more err@@ ors there are.
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for put@@ ting these little piec@@ es together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the err@@ or@@ s.
And this was our first att@@ em@@ p@@ t, starting with the digit@@ al information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4@@ .
It's a small virus that kill@@ s bac@@ teri@@ a.
We design@@ ed the piec@@ es, went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a DNA molec@@ u@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 letter@@ s.
The excit@@ ing ph@@ ase came when we took this piece of in@@ er@@ t chem@@ ical and put it in the bac@@ ter@@ ia, and the bac@@ ter@@ ia started to read this genet@@ ic co@@ de, made the vi@@ ral partic@@ l@@ es.
The vi@@ ral partic@@ les then were re@@ le@@ as@@ ed from the cells and came back and kill@@ ed the E@@ . co@@ li.
I was talking to the o@@ il industr@@ y recent@@ ly and I said they clear@@ ly underst@@ o@@ od that model@@ .
They lau@@ gh@@ ed more than you guys are.
And so, we think this is a situ@@ ation where the software can actually build its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a biolog@@ ical system.
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger@@ :
we wanted to build the entire bac@@ teri@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some --
it's over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 letter@@ s of genet@@ ic co@@ de --
so we thought we@@ 'd build them in c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es to understand what the actu@@ al compon@@ ents of a living cell are.
D@@ es@@ ign is crit@@ ic@@ al, and if you're starting with digit@@ al information in the comput@@ er, that digit@@ al information has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate.
When we first sequ@@ enc@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5, the stand@@ ard of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 10@@ ,000 base pa@@ ir@@ s.
We actually fo@@ und, on re@@ se@@ qu@@ enc@@ ing it, 30 err@@ or@@ s@@ ; had we used that origin@@ al sequ@@ ence, it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up.
Par@@ t of the design is design@@ ing piec@@ es that are 50 letter@@ s long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50@@ -@@ l@@ etter piec@@ es to build small@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together.
We design uni@@ que element@@ s into this.
You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in.
Th@@ in@@ k of this@@ : we have a four@@ -@@ l@@ etter genet@@ ic co@@ de -- A, C@@ , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ ets of those letter@@ s co@@ de for rou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ ino ac@@ id@@ s, such that there's a single l@@ etter design@@ ation for each of the am@@ ino ac@@ id@@ s.
So we can use the genet@@ ic co@@ de to write out wor@@ ds, sent@@ enc@@ es, thou@@ ght@@ s.
In@@ iti@@ ally, all we did was auto@@ gra@@ p@@ h it.
Some people were dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ed there was not po@@ et@@ r@@ y.
We design@@ ed these piec@@ es so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ mes@@ ;
there are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together.
And we started making piec@@ es, starting with piec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 letter@@ s, put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ etter piec@@ es, then put s@@ ets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0.
At each st@@ age, we gre@@ w up these piec@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we're trying to create a process that's ext@@ rem@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minut@@ e.
We're trying to get to the point of aut@@ om@@ ation.
So, this looks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all play@@ off@@ .
When we get into these really large piec@@ es over 100@@ ,000 base pa@@ ir@@ s, they won't any longer grow re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . coli --
it ex@@ h@@ au@@ sts all the moder@@ n tool@@ s of molec@@ ular biolog@@ y --
and so we turned to other me@@ ch@@ anis@@ m@@ s.
We knew there's a me@@ ch@@ anis@@ m called ho@@ mol@@ og@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biolog@@ y uses to re@@ pa@@ ir DNA that can put piec@@ es together.
Here's an example of it@@ :
there's an organis@@ m called De@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation.
You can see in the top pan@@ el, its ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some just gets b@@ low@@ n ap@@ art@@ .
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve to 2@@ 4 hours later, it put it back together exactly as it was befor@@ e.
We have thousands of organis@@ ms that can do this.
These organis@@ ms can be tot@@ ally de@@ sic@@ cat@@ ed@@ ;
they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um@@ .
I am absolutely certain that life can ex@@ i@@ st in out@@ er spac@@ e, move aro@@ und, find a new a@@ que@@ ous environ@@ ment.
In fact, N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sh@@ own a lot of this is out there.
Here's an actu@@ al micro@@ gra@@ p@@ h of the molec@@ u@@ le we built using these proc@@ ess@@ es, actually just using ye@@ ast me@@ ch@@ anis@@ ms with the right design of the piec@@ es we put them in@@ ;
ye@@ ast put@@ s them together aut@@ om@@ at@@ ic@@ ally.
This is not an elec@@ tro@@ n micro@@ graph@@ ; this is just a reg@@ ular pho@@ to@@ micro@@ graph@@ .
It's such a large molec@@ u@@ le we can see it with a light micro@@ sco@@ p@@ e.
These are pictu@@ res over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second perio@@ d.
So, this is the pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ ort while ago.
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 letter@@ s of genet@@ ic co@@ de@@ ;
it's the larg@@ est molec@@ u@@ le ever made by human@@ s of a defin@@ ed structu@@ re.
It's over 3@@ 00 million molec@@ ular we@@ i@@ ght.
If we pr@@ int@@ ed it out at a 10 fon@@ t with no spac@@ ing, it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pag@@ es just to pr@@ int this genet@@ ic co@@ de.
Well, how do we boo@@ t up a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some@@ ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate this@@ ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly, with a virus it's pretty simpl@@ e;
it's much more complic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with bac@@ teri@@ a.
It's also simpl@@ er when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like our@@ selv@@ es@@ : you can just po@@ p out the nucle@@ us and po@@ p in another one, and that's what you've all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing.
W@@ ith bac@@ ter@@ ia and Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a, the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell@@ , but we recent@@ ly show@@ ed that we can do a compl@@ ete trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one cell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it.
We pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species --
rou@@ gh@@ ly, these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tra gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ so@@ me,
we dig@@ est@@ ed it with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the prote@@ in@@ s,
and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you'll ap@@ preci@@ ate our very so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated graph@@ ics here. The new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some went into the cell@@ .
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it w@@ ent, but we tried to design the process a little bit fur@@ ther.
This is a maj@@ or me@@ ch@@ anis@@ m of evolu@@ tion right here.
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some or a third one from some@@ wh@@ ere, ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that speci@@ es.
So, people who think of evolu@@ tion as just one gen@@ e chang@@ ing at a time have mi@@ ss@@ ed much of biolog@@ y.
There are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es called re@@ str@@ ic@@ tion enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually dig@@ est DN@@ A.
The ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some that was in the cell doesn't have on@@ e;
the ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some we put in do@@ es.
It got ex@@ pres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some as for@@ e@@ ign materi@@ al, che@@ w@@ ed it up, and so we en@@ ded up just with a cell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ so@@ me.
It turned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it.
And with a very sh@@ ort peri@@ od of time, all the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it con@@ ver@@ ted tot@@ ally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell@@ .
All the prote@@ ins chang@@ ed, the membr@@ an@@ es chang@@ ed@@ ; when we read the genet@@ ic co@@ de, it's exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in.
So, this may sound like gen@@ omi@@ c al@@ chem@@ y, but we can@@ , by moving the software of DNA aro@@ und, change things quite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ic@@ ally.
Now I've argu@@ ed, this is not gen@@ es@@ is@@ ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evol@@ ut@@ ion. And I've argu@@ ed that we're about to perhaps create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ amb@@ ri@@ an exp@@ lo@@ sion@@ , where there's mas@@ sive new speci@@ ation based on this digit@@ al design@@ .
Why do this@@ ?
I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the need@@ s.
We're about to go from six and a half to n@@ ine billion people over the next 40 years.
To put it in cont@@ ex@@ t for my@@ self@@ : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6@@ ; within 40 years, ther@@ e@@ 'll be four@@ .
We have tro@@ u@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing, provi@@ ding fre@@ sh@@ , cle@@ an wat@@ er, medic@@ in@@ es, fu@@ el for the six and a half bill@@ ion.
It's going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine.
We use over five billion t@@ ons of co@@ al, 30 bill@@ ion@@ -@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il --
that's a h@@ und@@ red million bar@@ rel@@ s a day.
When we try to think of biolog@@ ical proc@@ es@@ ses or any process to re@@ place that, it's going to be a huge challeng@@ e.
Then of course, there's all that CO@@ 2 from this materi@@ al that end@@ s up in the atmo@@ sp@@ here.
We now, from our dis@@ co@@ very around the world, have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es, and I like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the futu@@ re.
The electr@@ on@@ ics industr@@ y only had a do@@ z@@ en or so compon@@ ent@@ s, and look at the divers@@ ity that came out of that.
We're limit@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biolog@@ ical real@@ ity and our imag@@ in@@ ation.
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es, because of these rapi@@ d me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ thes@@ is, to do what we're call@@ ing combin@@ atori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s.
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es a day.
When you think of proc@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze proc@@ es@@ ses to produce oc@@ t@@ ane or to produce ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ic@@ als, new vacc@@ in@@ es, we can just with a small te@@ am@@ , do more molec@@ ular biolog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ ence.
And it's just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion@@ :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ abilit@@ y, chem@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion, vacc@@ ine produc@@ tion, et@@ c@@ .
This is a scre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some true design software that we're working on to actually be able to si@@ t down and design species in the comput@@ er.
You know, we don't know necess@@ ar@@ ily what it@@ 'll look lik@@ e:
we know exactly what their genet@@ ic co@@ de looks lik@@ e.
We're foc@@ using on now four@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s.
You@@ 've seen recent@@ ly, cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment@@ .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s that will be coming out rel@@ ativ@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ gar@@ , to much high@@ er@@ -@@ val@@ ue fu@@ el@@ s like oc@@ t@@ ane or different ty@@ p@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol@@ .
But the only way we think that biolog@@ y can have a maj@@ or imp@@ act without fur@@ ther increas@@ ing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k, and so we're working with design@@ ing cells to go down this ro@@ ad. And we think we'll have the first four@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s in about 18 month@@ s.
S@@ un@@ light and CO@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ... but in our dis@@ co@@ very around the world, we have all kinds of other me@@ th@@ od@@ s.
This is an organis@@ m we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6@@ .
It lives in the de@@ ep oce@@ an, about a mi@@ le and a half de@@ ep@@ , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temper@@ atu@@ re@@ s.
It takes CO@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ ane using molec@@ ular hy@@ dro@@ g@@ en as its energy sourc@@ e.
We're looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red CO@@ 2, which can easi@@ ly be pi@@ ped to sit@@ es, con@@ ver@@ t that CO@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this proc@@ ess.
So, in a sh@@ ort peri@@ od of time, we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the basi@@ c question is of "@@ What is li@@ fe@@ ?" We tr@@ ul@@ y, you know, have mo@@ de@@ st go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole petro@@ l@@ -@@ chem@@ ical industr@@ y --
Ye@@ ah@@ . If you can't do that at TED@@ , where can you@@ ? --
become a maj@@ or source of energy ...
But al@@ so, we're now working on using these same tool@@ s to come up with inst@@ ant s@@ ets of vacc@@ in@@ es.
You@@ 've seen this year with flu@@ ; we're always a year behind and a doll@@ ar sh@@ ort when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine.
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ atori@@ al vacc@@ ines in adv@@ ance.
Here's what the future may beg@@ in to look like with chang@@ ing, now, the evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ ary tre@@ e, spe@@ ed@@ ing up evolu@@ tion with sy@@ n@@ th@@ et@@ ic bac@@ ter@@ ia, Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ ea and, ev@@ entu@@ ally, e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es.
We're a ways away from improv@@ ing peopl@@ e:
our go@@ al is just to make sure that we have a ch@@ ance to sur@@ vive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.
What I'm going to show you fir@@ st, as quick@@ ly as I can@@ , is some fo@@ und@@ ational work, some new technology that we brought to M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft as part of an acqu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago. This is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on, and it's an environ@@ ment
in which you can ei@@ ther loc@@ ally or remo@@ t@@ ely inter@@ act with v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of visu@@ al dat@@ a.
We're looking at man@@ y, many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ t@@ es of digit@@ al pho@@ to@@ s here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and continu@@ ously z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in, p@@ ann@@ ing through it, re@@ ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ing it in any way we want@@ .
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the imag@@ es are.
Mo@@ st of them are ordin@@ ary digit@@ al camera pho@@ to@@ s, but this one, for example, is a sc@@ an from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gre@@ s@@ s, and it's in the 3@@ 00 me@@ ga@@ pi@@ x@@ el r@@ ang@@ e.
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ou@@ ght to li@@ mi@@ t the performan@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ el@@ s on your scre@@ en at any given moment@@ . It's also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble architec@@ tu@@ re.
This is an entire boo@@ k, so this is an example of non-@@ im@@ age dat@@ a.
This is "@@ B@@ le@@ ak H@@ ou@@ se@@ " by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s. E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter.
To prove to you that it's really t@@ ex@@ t, and not an imag@@ e, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real represent@@ ation of the t@@ ext@@ ; it's not a pictu@@ re.
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ fici@@ al way to read an e-@@ boo@@ k.
I wouldn't re@@ com@@ men@@ d it.
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic cas@@ e, an is@@ sue of The Guar@@ di@@ an.
E@@ very large im@@ age is the beginning of a sec@@ tion.
And this really gives you the jo@@ y and the good experience of read@@ ing the real pa@@ per ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a new@@ sp@@ aper@@ , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um@@ .
We've done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular is@@ sue of The Guar@@ di@@ an.
We've made up a fa@@ ke ad that's very high re@@ solu@@ tion -- much high@@ er than in an ordin@@ ary ad -- and we've em@@ b@@ ed@@ ded ex@@ tra cont@@ ent.
If you want to see the fe@@ atu@@ res of this car@@ , you can see it here.
Or other model@@ s, or even tech@@ n@@ ical speci@@ fic@@ ations.
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on scre@@ en real est@@ ate.
We hope that this means no more po@@ p@@ -@@ up@@ s and other ru@@ bbi@@ sh like that -- sh@@ ouldn't be necess@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ f course, mapp@@ ing is one of those obvi@@ ous applic@@ ations for a technology like this.
And this one I really won't spend any time on, ex@@ ce@@ pt to say that we have things to cont@@ rib@@ ute to this fiel@@ d as well.
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U.S. super@@ im@@ posed on top of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ osp@@ ati@@ al imag@@ e.
So let's pul@@ l up, now, something el@@ se.
This is actually live on the We@@ b now@@ ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out.
This is a project called P@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th, which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technologi@@ es.
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful comput@@ er@@ -@@ vi@@ sion research done by No@@ a@@ h S@@ nav@@ ely, a gradu@@ ate stu@@ dent at the Univers@@ ity of W@@ ash@@ ing@@ t@@ on, co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by St@@ eve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W@@ . and R@@ ick S@@ z@@ eli@@ sk@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ so@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch. A very n@@ ice collabor@@ ation.
And so this is live on the We@@ b@@ . It's power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ rag@@ on.
You can see that when we do these sort@@ s of view@@ s, where we can di@@ ve through imag@@ es and have this kind of multi@@ -@@ re@@ solu@@ tion experi@@ ence.
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ r@@ ang@@ ement of the imag@@ es here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful@@ .
The computer vi@@ sion alg@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have regi@@ st@@ ered these imag@@ es together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sh@@ ot@@ s -- all taken ne@@ ar G@@ r@@ as@@ si L@@ ak@@ es in the Can@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ ki@@ es -- all these sh@@ ot@@ s were ta@@ k@@ en. So you see element@@ s here of st@@ abi@@ li@@ zed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing, and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ment@@ s.
Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al.
I would like to j@@ um@@ p stra@@ ight to one of No@@ ah@@ 's origin@@ al dat@@ a-@@ s@@ ets -- this is from an early proto@@ type that we first got working this sum@@ m@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch line behind the P@@ ho@@ to@@ sy@@ n@@ th technolog@@ y, It's not necess@@ ar@@ ily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments we've put up on the web@@ sit@@ e.
We had to wor@@ ry about the law@@ y@@ ers and so on.
This is a re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ d@@ ral that was done enti@@ re@@ ly comput@@ ation@@ ally from imag@@ es sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ l@@ ick@@ r. You just type N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ l@@ ick@@ r@@ , and you get some pictu@@ res of guys in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts, and of the cam@@ pu@@ s and so on. And each of these or@@ ange con@@ es represent@@ s an im@@ age that was discover@@ ed to b@@ el@@ ong to this model@@ .
And so these are all F@@ l@@ ick@@ r imag@@ es, and they've all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way.
We can just nav@@ ig@@ ate in this very simple way.
You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at M@@ ic@@ ro@@ sof@@ t.
It's very gr@@ ati@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rece@@ ption here.
I gu@@ ess you can see this is lots of different ty@@ p@@ es of cam@@ er@@ as@@ : it's everything from cell@@ -@@ phone cam@@ er@@ as to profession@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s, quite a large number of them, st@@ it@@ ched together in this environ@@ ment.
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ir@@ d ones --
So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by fac@@ es, and so on.
So@@ me@@ where in here there is actually a seri@@ es of photograph@@ s -- here we go.
This is actually a post@@ er of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that regi@@ st@@ ered cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ly.
We can di@@ ve in from the post@@ er to a physical view of this environ@@ ment.
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environ@@ ment. This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y, visu@@ ally, of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together.
Th@@ ose pho@@ to@@ s become lin@@ k@@ ed, and they make something emerg@@ ent that's great@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s.
You have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire Ear@@ th.
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er@@ 's V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al Earth work.
And this is something that grow@@ s in compl@@ ex@@ ity as people use it, and wh@@ ose ben@@ ef@@ its become great@@ er to the us@@ ers as they use it.
Th@@ e@@ ir own pho@@ to@@ s are getting t@@ agg@@ ed with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else ent@@ er@@ ed.
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ int@@ s and say who they all are, then my pho@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ d@@ ral sud@@ den@@ ly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that dat@@ a, and I can use it as an entr@@ y point to di@@ ve into that spac@@ e, into that met@@ a-@@ ver@@ se, using everybody el@@ se@@ 's pho@@ to@@ s, and do a kind of a cro@@ ss@@ -@@ mo@@ dal and cro@@ ss@@ -@@ us@@ er social experience that way.
And of course, a b@@ y-@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ se@@ ly ric@@ h virtu@@ al model@@ s of every interesting part of the Ear@@ th, collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satell@@ ite imag@@ es and so on, but from the collec@@ tive mem@@ or@@ y.
Thank you so much.
Chris An@@ der@@ son@@ : Do I understand this right? What your software is going to allow@@ , is that at some point@@ , really within the next few years, all the pictu@@ res that are shar@@ ed by any@@ one across the world are going to lin@@ k toge@@ ther@@ ?
B@@ A@@ A: Y@@ es. What this is really doing is discover@@ ing,
creating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks, if you wi@@ ll@@ , between imag@@ es.
It's doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the imag@@ es.
And that gets really excit@@ ing when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ ness of the sem@@ anti@@ c information a lot of imag@@ es hav@@ e.
Li@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ arch for imag@@ es, you type in ph@@ r@@ as@@ es, and the t@@ ex@@ t on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information about what that picture is of@@ .
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pictu@@ re@@ s?
The amount of sem@@ anti@@ c inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ ch@@ ness that comes out of that is really hu@@ g@@ e.
It's a clas@@ sic net@@ work effec@@ t.
CA: T@@ rul@@ y incredi@@ ble. Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations.
You know, one of the inten@@ se pl@@ eas@@ u@@ res of trav@@ el and one of the de@@ li@@ ghts of e@@ th@@ no@@ graph@@ ic research is the opportun@@ ity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ go@@ tt@@ en the old wa@@ ys, who still feel their past in the win@@ d, tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in, ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter le@@ av@@ es of plant@@ s.
Just to know that J@@ agu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still jour@@ ney bey@@ ond the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ a@@ y, or the my@@ th@@ s of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still re@@ son@@ ate with mean@@ ing, or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a, the Bu@@ dd@@ hist@@ s still pur@@ sue the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma, is to really remember the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y, and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ i@@ st in some absolut@@ e sen@@ se, but is just one model of real@@ ity,
the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age ma@@ de, al@@ be@@ it success@@ full@@ y, many gener@@ ations ago.
And of course, we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ativ@@ es.
We're all bor@@ n. We all bring our children into the world.
We go through in@@ iti@@ ation rit@@ es.
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of de@@ a@@ th, so it sh@@ ouldn't surpri@@ se us that we all s@@ ing, we all d@@ ance,
we all have art@@ .
But what's interesting is the uni@@ que c@@ ad@@ ence of the son@@ g, the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cultu@@ re.
And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forest@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o, or the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o a@@ col@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ it@@ i, or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t de@@ ser@@ t of Nor@@ ther@@ n Ken@@ y@@ a, the C@@ ur@@ and@@ ero in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ de@@ s, or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the S@@ a@@ har@@ a --
this is inci@@ dent@@ ally the f@@ ell@@ ow that I trav@@ el@@ ed into the de@@ ser@@ t with a mon@@ th ago -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ o@@ mol@@ ang@@ ma, Ever@@ est@@ , the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss mother of the world.
All of these peopl@@ es te@@ ach us that there are other ways of be@@ ing, other ways of thin@@ king, other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing your@@ self in the Ear@@ th.
And this is an idea, if you think about it, can only f@@ ill you with hop@@ e.
Now, together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultu@@ res of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ rit@@ ual life and cultu@@ ral life that en@@ velo@@ ps the plan@@ et, and is as important to the well@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the biolog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here.
And you might think of this cultu@@ ral we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, and you might de@@ fine the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here as being the su@@ m tot@@ al of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ am@@ s, my@@ th@@ s, ide@@ as, inspi@@ r@@ ations, intu@@ it@@ ions brought into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation since the da@@ w@@ n of consci@@ ous@@ nes@@ s.
The e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here is human@@ it@@ y's great leg@@ ac@@ y.
It's the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive speci@@ es.
And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been sever@@ ely ero@@ de@@ d, so too is the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here -- and, if any@@ thing, at a far great@@ er rat@@ e.
No bi@@ ologi@@ st@@ s, for example, would dare sugg@@ est that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ext@@ inc@@ tion because it simply is not tru@@ e, and yet that -- the most a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of biolog@@ ical divers@@ ity -- scar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sti@@ c scen@@ ario in the real@@ m of cultu@@ ral diver@@ sit@@ y.
And the great indic@@ at@@ or of that, of course, is language lo@@ s@@ s.
When each of you in this room were bor@@ n, there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the plan@@ et.
Now, a language is not just a body of voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mat@@ ical rul@@ es.
A language is a f@@ las@@ h of the human spi@@ rit@@ .
It's a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the materi@@ al world.
E@@ very language is an ol@@ d-@@ grow@@ th for@@ est of the min@@ d, a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed, a thought, an e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ rit@@ ual possibilit@@ i@@ es.
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ag@@ es, as we si@@ t here today in Mon@@ ter@@ e@@ y, fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children@@ .
They're no longer being ta@@ ught to babi@@ es, which mean@@ s, effec@@ tiv@@ ely, un@@ less something chang@@ es, they're already de@@ ad.
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ velo@@ ped in sil@@ ence, to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your langu@@ age, to have no way to pas@@ s on the w@@ is@@ dom of the anc@@ est@@ ors or ant@@ icip@@ ate the pro@@ mi@@ se of the children@@ ?
And y@@ et, that d@@ read@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of somebody some@@ where on Earth rou@@ gh@@ ly every two wee@@ ks, because every two wee@@ ks, some el@@ der di@@ es and carri@@ es with him into the gr@@ ave the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an anci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e.
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be bet@@ ter,
wouldn't the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one langu@@ ag@@ e?" And I say, "@@ Gre@@ at, let's make that language Yor@@ u@@ b@@ a. Let's make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ es@@ e.
Let's make it K@@ o@@ gi@@ ."
And you'll sud@@ den@@ ly dis@@ cover what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own langu@@ age.
And so, what I'd like to do with you today is sort of take you on a jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here,
a bri@@ e@@ f jour@@ ney through the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here, to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being lo@@ st.
Now, there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say "@@ different ways of be@@ ing@@ ," I really do mean different ways of be@@ ing.
T@@ ak@@ e, for example, this child of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on, the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mi@@ l@@ k riv@@ er from the e@@ ast in the bell@@ y of sac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es.
Now, this is a people who cogn@@ iti@@ v@@ ely do not dist@@ ingu@@ ish the colo@@ r bl@@ ue from the colo@@ r gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est u@@ po@@ n which the people depen@@ d.
They have a curi@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called "@@ lingu@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y@@ :@@ " you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ a@@ ks a different langu@@ age.
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical pa@@ st, yet the curi@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es, where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age, you never hear any@@ one pract@@ ic@@ ing a langu@@ age.
They simply list@@ en and then beg@@ in to spe@@ a@@ k.
Or@@ , one of the most f@@ ascin@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever liv@@ ed with@@ , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or, an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 19@@ 5@@ 8@@ .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7@@ , five missi@@ on@@ ari@@ es att@@ em@@ pt@@ ed cont@@ act and made a crit@@ ical mist@@ ak@@ e.
They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ lo@@ ss@@ y photograph@@ s of them@@ selves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly gest@@ ure@@ s, for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ infor@@ est had never seen anything tw@@ o-@@ dimension@@ al in their liv@@ es.
They pic@@ ked up these photograph@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or, tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figu@@ re, found no@@ thing, and conclu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l@@ , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the five missi@@ on@@ ari@@ es to de@@ a@@ th.
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn't just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ der@@ s.
They sp@@ ear@@ ed each other.
5@@ 4 percent of their mort@@ al@@ ity was due to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other.
We trac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations, and we found two inst@@ anc@@ es of natural de@@ ath and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it, they ad@@ m@@ it@@ ted that one of the f@@ ell@@ ow@@ s had go@@ tt@@ en so old that he di@@ ed getting ol@@ d, so we sp@@ ear@@ ed him any@@ way. But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowled@@ ge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing.
Th@@ e@@ ir hun@@ ters could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it beh@@ in@@ d.
In the early '@@ 8@@ 0@@ s, I had a really ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ esso@@ r at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to H@@ a@@ it@@ i, inf@@ il@@ tr@@ ating the se@@ cre@@ t societ@@ ies which were the fo@@ und@@ ation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er@@ 's str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ ont@@ on Ma@@ co@@ ut@@ es, and se@@ cur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es.
In order to make sense out of sens@@ ation, of course, I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ ith of Vo@@ do@@ un@@ . And Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black mag@@ ic cul@@ t.
On the contr@@ ar@@ y, it's a complex met@@ ap@@ hy@@ s@@ ical world@@ view@@ .
It's interest@@ ing.
If I asked you to name the great relig@@ ions of the world, what would you sa@@ y?
Chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity, Is@@ lam@@ , Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ is@@ m, Ju@@ da@@ is@@ m, what@@ ever@@ .
There's always one contin@@ ent left out, the as@@ sum@@ ption being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous beli@@ ef@@ s. Well, of course, they did and Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ sti@@ ll@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gi@@ c Di@@ asp@@ ora of the s@@ lav@@ er@@ y er@@ a.
B@@ ut, what makes Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it's this living relation@@ ship between the living and the de@@ ad.
So, the living give bir@@ th to the spi@@ rit@@ s.
The spi@@ rit@@ s can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ at@@ er, respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to moment@@ ar@@ ily dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the liv@@ ing, so that for that bri@@ e@@ f sh@@ ining moment@@ , the a@@ col@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d.
That's why the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ist@@ s like to say that "@@ You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about Go@@ d.
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and become Go@@ d@@ ."
And because you are poss@@ es@@ se@@ d, you are taken by the spi@@ ri@@ t -- how can you be har@@ med@@ ?
So you see these ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation@@ s: Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o a@@ col@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ ber@@ s with im@@ pun@@ ity, a rather ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ar@@ s it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the state of ex@@ tre@@ me excit@@ ation.
Now, of all the peopl@@ es that I've ever been with@@ , the most extra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Si@@ erra N@@ ev@@ a@@ da de S@@ anta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a.
D@@ es@@ c@@ end@@ ants of the anci@@ ent T@@ ai@@ ron@@ a civi@@ liz@@ ation which once car@@ pet@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a, in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ quest@@ , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ar@@ s ab@@ ove the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain@@ .
In a bloo@@ d@@ stain@@ ed contin@@ ent, these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ p@@ ani@@ sh@@ .
To this day, they re@@ main rul@@ ed by a rit@@ ual pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od is rather extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ y.
The young a@@ col@@ y@@ t@@ es are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four@@ , se@@ quest@@ ered in a sh@@ a@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 year@@ s:
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year perio@@ ds de@@ liber@@ at@@ ely cho@@ se@@ n to mi@@ mi@@ c the n@@ ine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ ther.
And for this entire time, they are inc@@ ul@@ tur@@ ated into the valu@@ es of their societ@@ y, valu@@ es that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the pro@@ positi@@ on that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the cos@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical -- bal@@ ance.
And at the end of this amazing in@@ iti@@ ation, one day they're sud@@ den@@ ly taken out and for the first time in their liv@@ es, at the age of 18@@ , they see a sun@@ ris@@ e. And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un begin@@ s to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beautiful land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, sud@@ den@@ ly everything they have learned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning g@@ lor@@ y. And the pri@@ est ste@@ ps back
and says, "@@ You se@@ e? It's really as I've told you.
It is that beauti@@ ful@@ . It is your@@ s to protec@@ t@@ ."
They call them@@ selves the "@@ el@@ der bro@@ ther@@ s@@ " and they say w@@ e, who are the youn@@ g@@ er bro@@ ther@@ s, are the ones responsi@@ ble for dest@@ ro@@ ying the world.
Now, this level of intu@@ ition be@@ comes very important@@ .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, we ei@@ ther in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the "@@ no@@ ble sav@@ ag@@ e@@ ," which is an idea rac@@ i@@ st in its sim@@ plic@@ ity, or altern@@ ativ@@ ely, we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ or@@ e@@ a@@ u and say these people are clo@@ s@@ er to the Earth than we are.
Well, indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sent@@ iment@@ al no@@ r we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by nost@@ al@@ gi@@ a.
There's not a lot of room for ei@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ amp@@ s of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the chi@@ lling win@@ ds of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , but they hav@@ e, ne@@ ver@@ the@@ les@@ s, through time and rit@@ u@@ al, for@@ g@@ ed a tradit@@ ional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it, but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er intu@@ it@@ ion@@ : the idea that the Earth it@@ self can only ex@@ i@@ st because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human consci@@ ous@@ nes@@ s.
Now, what does that mean@@ ?
It means that a young ki@@ d from the An@@ des who's ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is an A@@ p@@ u spi@@ ri@@ t that will direc@@ t his or her dest@@ in@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relation@@ ship to that re@@ source or that place than a young ki@@ d from M@@ ont@@ ana ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a mo@@ un@@ ta@@ in is a pi@@ le of roc@@ k ready to be min@@ ed.
Wh@@ e@@ ther it's the ab@@ o@@ de of a spi@@ ri@@ t or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant@@ .
What's interesting is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relation@@ ship between the individu@@ al and the natural world.
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the forest@@ s of Brit@@ ish Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those forest@@ s exist@@ ed to be c@@ ut@@ .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forest@@ s were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ av@@ en and the c@@ ann@@ i@@ b@@ al spi@@ rit@@ s that d@@ well@@ ed at the n@@ orth end of the world, spi@@ rit@@ s they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa in@@ iti@@ ation.
Now, if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cultu@@ res could create different real@@ iti@@ es, you could beg@@ in to understand some of their extra@@ ordin@@ ary discover@@ i@@ es. T@@ ake this pl@@ ant here.
It's a photogra@@ p@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l@@ .
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ asc@@ a, which many of you have heard ab@@ out, the most powerful psy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive prepar@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an@@ 's re@@ per@@ to@@ i@@ re.
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca f@@ ascin@@ ating is not the she@@ er ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ colo@@ g@@ ical pot@@ ential of this prepar@@ ation, but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it. It's made really of two different sourc@@ es@@ :
on the one hand@@ , this wo@@ o@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a seri@@ es of bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ ol@@ in@@ es, har@@ min@@ e, har@@ mal@@ ine, mi@@ l@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is rather to have sort of bl@@ ue h@@ az@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it's mi@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ av@@ es of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ ee family called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ di@@ s.
This pl@@ ant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ pt@@ amin@@ es, very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in, di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine, 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ ox@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine.
If you've ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i b@@ low@@ ing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ s@@ es, that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also cont@@ ain@@ s me@@ th@@ ox@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine.
To have that pow@@ der b@@ low@@ n up your no@@ se is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ que paint@@ ings and land@@ ing on a se@@ a of electr@@ ic@@ ity. It doesn't create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ it@@ y@@ ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solu@@ tion of real@@ ity.
In fact, I used to argu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or, Ri@@ char@@ d E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ t@@ es -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ de@@ li@@ c era with his dis@@ co@@ very of the mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ room@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s --
I used to argu@@ e that you couldn't clas@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ pt@@ amin@@ es as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you're under the effec@@ ts there's no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation. But the thing about tr@@ y@@ pt@@ amin@@ es is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they're den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ id@@ as@@ e.
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ atu@@ res the M@@ A@@ O@@ .
Now, the f@@ ascin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort necess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ am@@ ine. So you ask your@@ self a quest@@ ion. H@@ ow, in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plant@@ s, do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated pl@@ ants that when comb@@ ined in this way, created a kind of bio@@ chem@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being great@@ er than the su@@ m of the part@@ s?
Well, we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ is@@ m, "@@ tri@@ al and err@@ or@@ ," which is ex@@ posed to be mean@@ ing@@ les@@ s.
But you ask the Indi@@ an@@ s, and they say, "The pl@@ ants talk to us@@ ."
Well, what does that mean@@ ?
This tri@@ be, the C@@ of@@ an, has 1@@ 7 vari@@ et@@ ies of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ asc@@ a, all of which they dist@@ ingu@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the forest@@ , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our ey@@ e as one speci@@ es.
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say, "I thought you knew something about plant@@ s. I mean, don't you know any@@ thing@@ ?" And I said, "@@ No@@ ."
Well, it turns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 vari@@ et@@ ies in the night of a full mo@@ on, and it sing@@ s to you in a different ke@@ y.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ v@@ ar@@ d, but it's a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ en@@ s.
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ path@@ et@@ ic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ gin@@ s of history as the real world, mean@@ ing our world, mo@@ ves on.
Well, the tr@@ ut@@ h is the 20@@ th centur@@ y, 3@@ 00 years from now, is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technolog@@ ical innov@@ ations, but rather as the era in which we sto@@ od by and ei@@ ther ac@@ tiv@@ ely end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ v@@ ely acc@@ e@@ pt@@ ed the mas@@ sive de@@ struc@@ tion of both biolog@@ ical and cultu@@ ral divers@@ ity on the plan@@ et. Now, the problem isn't chang@@ e.
All cultu@@ res through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possibilit@@ ies of life.
And the problem is not technology it@@ self.
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an American stop@@ ped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y.
It's not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here. It is pow@@ er,
the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation.
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world, you dis@@ cover that these are not cultu@@ res dest@@ ined to f@@ ade a@@ wa@@ y@@ ;
these are dy@@ nam@@ ic living peopl@@ es being driv@@ en out of exist@@ ence by identi@@ fi@@ able forc@@ es that are bey@@ ond their capac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to@@ :
whether it's the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ forest@@ ation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an --
a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a, from Sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who liv@@ ed free in the for@@ est until a gener@@ ation ago, and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to ser@@ vit@@ u@@ de and pro@@ st@@ itu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s, where you can see the riv@@ er it@@ self is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South Ch@@ ina Se@@ a, where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ters h@@ an@@ g light in the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on
ready to f@@ ill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the for@@ est --
or, in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i, it's the dise@@ ase ent@@ ities that have come in, in the wa@@ ke of the dis@@ co@@ very of gol@@ d.
Or if we go into the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of T@@ i@@ bet@@ , where I'm doing a lot of research recent@@ ly, you'll see it's a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation.
You know, gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de, the physical ext@@ inc@@ tion of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de, the de@@ struc@@ tion of peopl@@ e's way of life, is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ne@@ d, it's univers@@ ally, in many quar@@ ter@@ s, celebr@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y.
And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level@@ .
I once trav@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 mi@@ les from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ ester@@ n Ch@@ ina over@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a young colle@@ agu@@ e, and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I underst@@ o@@ od the face behind the stati@@ st@@ ics you hear ab@@ out@@ :
6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and ash@@ es,
1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tu@@ ral R@@ evol@@ ut@@ ion.
This young man@@ 's father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a.
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ ant@@ ly kill@@ ed at the time of the Chin@@ ese inv@@ a@@ sion@@ .
H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ in@@ ess in the Di@@ asp@@ ora that took the people to Ne@@ p@@ al.
H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y.
He was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t tail@@ s because she couldn't be@@ ar to be without him@@ .
The sist@@ er who had done that br@@ ave de@@ ed was put into an education cam@@ p.
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ tent@@ ly ste@@ pped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of Ma@@ o, and for that trans@@ gre@@ ssi@@ on, she was given seven years of hard labor@@ .
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar@@ , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spi@@ ri@@ t of the people is something to be@@ hol@@ d.
And in the en@@ d, then, it really comes down to a cho@@ ic@@ e:
do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to embr@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ m@@ atic world of diver@@ sit@@ y?
Mar@@ g@@ are@@ t M@@ e@@ ad, the great an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ st, said, before she di@@ ed, that her great@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ ft@@ ed to@@ wards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gen@@ eri@@ c world view not only would we see the entire r@@ ange of the human imag@@ in@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more nar@@ row mo@@ d@@ al@@ ity of thought, but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day having for@@ go@@ tt@@ en there were even other possibilit@@ i@@ es.
And it's hum@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species h@@ as, per@@ hap@@ s, been around for [@@ 1@@ 50@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ] years.
The Ne@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolu@@ tion -- which gave us ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, at which time we su@@ c@@ cu@@ mb@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed@@ ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od@@ ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ aliz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago.
The moder@@ n industri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years ol@@ d.
Now, that sh@@ allow history doesn't sugg@@ est to me that we have all the answ@@ ers for all of the challeng@@ es that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ ni@@ a.
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cultu@@ res of the world are asked the mean@@ ing of being human@@ , they respon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different vo@@ ic@@ es.
And it's within that son@@ g that we will all re@@ dis@@ cover the possibilit@@ y of being what we are@@ : a fully consci@@ ous speci@@ es, fully aw@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peopl@@ es and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh@@ . And there are great moment@@ s of op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sm@@ .
This is a photogra@@ p@@ h I took at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people, and this man, O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k, told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ fa@@ ther.
The Can@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people, and during the 19@@ 50@@ s, to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ t@@ y, we forc@@ ed them into sett@@ l@@ ement@@ s.
This old man@@ 's grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go.
The fam@@ il@@ y, f@@ ear@@ ful for his life, took away all of his we@@ ap@@ on@@ s, all of his tool@@ s.
Now, you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d@@ ; they took adv@@ ant@@ age of it.
The run@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ led@@ s were origin@@ ally made of fish w@@ ra@@ pped in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou h@@ ide@@ .
So, this man@@ 's grand@@ father was not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the b@@ li@@ zz@@ ard that was b@@ low@@ ing.
He simply sli@@ pped out@@ si@@ de, pu@@ ll@@ ed down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tro@@ us@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his hand@@ . And as the f@@ ec@@ es began to free@@ z@@ e, he shap@@ ed it into the form of a bl@@ a@@ de.
He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it fin@@ ally fro@@ ze sol@@ i@@ d, he b@@ ut@@ ch@@ ered a do@@ g with it.
He s@@ kin@@ ned the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ nes@@ s, took the rib@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a sl@@ ed, har@@ ness@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g, and dis@@ appear@@ ed over the ice flo@@ es, sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in b@@ el@@ t.
Talk about getting by with no@@ thing. And this, in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the resi@@ li@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world.
The Can@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to tot@@ al control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larg@@ er than Californi@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together.
It's our new hom@@ el@@ and@@ . It's called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut@@ .
It's an in@@ depen@@ dent ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y. They control all min@@ er@@ al resourc@@ es.
A@@ n amazing example of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ state can see@@ k rest@@ itu@@ tion with its people.
And fin@@ ally, in the en@@ d, I think it's pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who@@ 've trav@@ el@@ ed in these remo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et, to realize that they're not remo@@ te at all.
They're hom@@ el@@ ands of some@@ bod@@ y.
They re@@ present br@@ an@@ ch@@ es of the human imag@@ in@@ ation that go back to the da@@ w@@ n of time. And for all of us, the dre@@ am@@ s of these children@@ , like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own children@@ , become part of the n@@ a@@ ked ge@@ o@@ graph@@ y of hop@@ e.
So, what we're trying to do at the N@@ ational Ge@@ o@@ graph@@ ic, fin@@ ally, is, we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh any@@ thing.
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics --
-- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve, but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world, and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling inst@@ itu@@ tion in the world. We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our web@@ s@@ ite every mon@@ th.
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tele@@ vi@@ sion chan@@ ne@@ l@@ .
Our mag@@ az@@ ines are read by mill@@ ions.
And what we're doing is a seri@@ es of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ no@@ sp@@ here where we're going to take our audi@@ ence to places of such cultu@@ ral won@@ der that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have se@@ en, and hop@@ e@@ full@@ y, ther@@ e@@ for@@ e, embr@@ ace gradu@@ ally, one by one, the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ og@@ y: that this world de@@ serv@@ es to ex@@ i@@ st in a diverse way, that we can find a way to live in a tr@@ ul@@ y mul@@ t@@ icul@@ tur@@ al, pl@@ ur@@ alist@@ ic world
where all of the w@@ is@@ dom of all peopl@@ es can cont@@ rib@@ ute to our collec@@ tive well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of min@@ e that I hope will re@@ son@@ ate with other things you've already hear@@ d, and I'll try to make some connec@@ tions my@@ self, in case you mi@@ ss@@ ed them.
But I want to start with what I call the "@@ off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma@@ ."
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what@@ ?
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all W@@ ester@@ n industri@@ al societ@@ i@@ es. And the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma run@@ s like this@@ : if we are interested in ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ z@@ ing the w@@ el@@ fare of our citi@@ z@@ en@@ s, the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze individu@@ al free@@ do@@ m.
The reason for this is both that free@@ dom is in and of it@@ self go@@ od, valu@@ able, wor@@ th@@ wh@@ il@@ e, ess@@ ential to being human@@ .
And because if people have free@@ do@@ m, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze our w@@ el@@ far@@ e, and no one has to deci@@ de on our be@@ hal@@ f@@ .
The way to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze free@@ dom is to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze cho@@ ice.
The more cho@@ ice people hav@@ e, the more free@@ dom they hav@@ e, and the more free@@ dom they hav@@ e, the more w@@ el@@ fare they hav@@ e.
Th@@ is, I think, is so de@@ e@@ ply em@@ b@@ ed@@ ded in the water sup@@ ply that it wouldn't occu@@ r to any@@ one to question it.
And it's also de@@ e@@ ply em@@ b@@ ed@@ ded in our liv@@ es.
I'll give you some exampl@@ es of what moder@@ n progre@@ ss has made possible for us.
This is my super@@ mark@@ et. Not such a big one.
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing.
1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sing@@ s in my super@@ mark@@ et, if you don't coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in ol@@ i@@ ve o@@ il@@ s and 12 bal@@ s@@ am@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ar@@ s you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sing@@ s, in the off@@ -@@ ch@@ ance that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you.
So this is what the super@@ market is lik@@ e.
And then you go to the consum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ics st@@ ore to set up a st@@ ere@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers, C@@ D play@@ er, t@@ ap@@ e play@@ er, t@@ un@@ er, amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er --
and in this one single consum@@ er electr@@ on@@ ics stor@@ e, there are that many st@@ ere@@ o system@@ s.
We can con@@ struc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ million different st@@ ere@@ o system@@ s out of the compon@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one stor@@ e.
You@@ 've got to ad@@ mi@@ t that's a lot of cho@@ ice.
In other do@@ ma@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations.
There was a time, when I was a bo@@ y, when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone serv@@ ice you want@@ ed, as long as it came from Ma B@@ ell@@ .
You r@@ ent@@ ed your ph@@ one. You didn't buy it.
One con@@ sequ@@ ence of that, by the way, is that the phone never bro@@ k@@ e.
And those days are g@@ one.
We now have an almost un@@ limit@@ ed vari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ on@@ es, espe@@ ci@@ ally in the world of cell ph@@ on@@ es.
These are cell ph@@ ones of the futu@@ re.
My favor@@ ite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er, no@@ se h@@ air tri@@ m@@ mer@@ , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch.
And if by some ch@@ ance you hav@@ en't seen that in your st@@ ore y@@ et, you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on, you wi@@ ll@@ .
And what this does is it lead@@ s people to walk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this quest@@ ion. And do you know what the answer to this question now is@@ ? The answer is "@@ no@@ ."
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
So, in other asp@@ ec@@ ts of life that are much more signific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things, the same exp@@ lo@@ sion of cho@@ ice is tru@@ e.
He@@ alth car@@ e. It is no longer the case in the United St@@ ates that you go to the doc@@ tor@@ , and the doc@@ tor tell@@ s you what to do.
In@@ ste@@ ad, you go to the doc@@ tor@@ , and the doc@@ tor tell@@ s you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B@@ . A has these ben@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ ks. B has these ben@@ ef@@ it@@ s, and these ris@@ ks. What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "D@@ oc@@ , what should I do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c says, "@@ A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks, and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks.
What do you want to do@@ ?"
And you say, "@@ If you were me, D@@ oc@@ , what would you do@@ ?"
And the do@@ c says, "@@ But I'm not you@@ ."
And the resul@@ t is -- we call it "@@ pati@@ ent aut@@ on@@ om@@ y@@ ," which makes it sound like a good thing,
but it really is a shi@@ ft@@ ing of the bur@@ den and the responsi@@ bilit@@ y for decision@@ -@@ making from somebody who know@@ s something -- nam@@ ely, the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who know@@ s nothing and is almost certa@@ inly sic@@ k and th@@ us not in the best shap@@ e to be making decision@@ s -- nam@@ ely, the pati@@ ent.
There's enor@@ m@@ ous market@@ ing of pre@@ scri@@ ption dru@@ gs to people like you and me, wh@@ ich@@ , if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them.
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them@@ ?
The answer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our doc@@ tors the next mor@@ ning and ask for our pre@@ script@@ ions to be chang@@ ed.
So@@ me@@ thing as d@@ ram@@ atic as our ident@@ ity has now become a matter of cho@@ ice, as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to indic@@ ate. We don't in@@ her@@ it an ident@@ it@@ y@@ ; we get to inv@@ ent it.
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we lik@@ e.
And that means that every day, when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ n@@ ing, you have to deci@@ de what kind of person you want to b@@ e.
W@@ ith re@@ sp@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ il@@ y, there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ul@@ t as@@ sum@@ ption that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you coul@@ d, and then you started having kids as so@@ on as you coul@@ d.
The only real cho@@ ice was wh@@ o, not wh@@ en, and not what you did af@@ ter.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys, everything is very much up for gra@@ b@@ s.
I te@@ ach wonder@@ fully intellig@@ ent student@@ s, and I assi@@ gn 20 percent less work than I used to.
And it's not because they're less s@@ mar@@ t, and it's not because they're less di@@ li@@ g@@ ent.
It's because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed, as@@ king them@@ selv@@ es, "S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or not@@ ? Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed now@@ ?
Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed lat@@ er@@ ? Sh@@ ould I have kids fir@@ st, or a care@@ er fir@@ st@@ ?"
All of these are consum@@ ing question@@ s.
And they're going to answer these question@@ s, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assi@@ gn and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es.
And in@@ de@@ ed they sh@@ oul@@ d. These are important questions to answ@@ er.
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ es@@ se@@ d, as Car@@ l was point@@ ing out, with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ ute of every day from any place on the planet -- ex@@ ce@@ pt the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el@@ .
There is one cor@@ n@@ er, by the way, that I'm not going to tell any@@ body ab@@ out, where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually work@@ s.
I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.
So what this mean@@ s, this incredible free@@ dom of cho@@ ice we have with re@@ sp@@ ect to work, is that we have to make a decision@@ , again and again and again, about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn't be work@@ ing.
We can go to wat@@ ch our ki@@ d play so@@ c@@ cer@@ , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p, and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p, and our l@@ ap@@ to@@ p, pre@@ sum@@ ab@@ ly, on our l@@ ap@@ s.
And even if they're all sh@@ ut off@@ , every min@@ ute that we're wat@@ ching our ki@@ d mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ate a so@@ cc@@ er gam@@ e, we are also as@@ king our@@ selv@@ es, "S@@ h@@ ould I answer this cell phone call@@ ?
Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this em@@ ail@@ ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this letter@@ ?"
And even if the answer to the question is "@@ no@@ ," it's certa@@ inly going to make the experience of your ki@@ d@@ 's so@@ cc@@ er game very different than it w@@ oul@@ d@@ 've be@@ en.
So every@@ where we loo@@ k, big things and small things, materi@@ al things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le things, life is a matter of cho@@ ice.
And the world we used to live in looked like this. [@@ Well, actually, they are writ@@ t@@ en in st@@ on@@ e@@ .@@ ] That is to say, there were some cho@@ ic@@ es, but not everything was a matter of cho@@ ice.
And the world we now live in looks like this. [@@ The T@@ en Com@@ man@@ d@@ ments D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it@@ ] And the question is, is this good new@@ s, or bad new@@ s?
And the answer is, "@@ y@@ es@@ ."
We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.
All of this cho@@ ice has two effec@@ ts, two neg@@ ative effec@@ ts on people.
One effec@@ t, par@@ ado@@ x@@ ic@@ ally, is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s, rather than liber@@ ation.
W@@ ith so many op@@ tions to cho@@ ose fro@@ m, people find it very difficult to cho@@ ose at all.
I'll give you one very d@@ ram@@ atic example of this@@ : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ rem@@ ent plan@@ s.
A colle@@ ag@@ ue of min@@ e got access to invest@@ ment recor@@ ds from V@@ an@@ guar@@ d, the gi@@ g@@ anti@@ c mut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und company of about a million em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different work@@ plac@@ es.
And what she found is that for every 10 mut@@ ual fun@@ ds the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed, r@@ ate of part@@ icip@@ ation went down two percent@@ .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ w@@ er em@@ plo@@ ye@@ es part@@ icip@@ ate than if you only off@@ er fi@@ ve. Wh@@ y?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to cho@@ ose fro@@ m, it's so dam@@ n hard to deci@@ de which f@@ und to cho@@ os@@ e, that you'll just put it off until to@@ mor@@ row@@ .
And then to@@ mor@@ row@@ , and to@@ mor@@ row@@ , and to@@ mor@@ row@@ , and of course to@@ mor@@ row never com@@ es.
Un@@ der@@ st@@ and that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don't have enough money put a@@ way, it also means that making the deci@@ sion is so hard that they pas@@ s up signific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er.
B@@ y not part@@ ici@@ pat@@ ing, they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year from the em@@ plo@@ y@@ er, who would hap@@ pi@@ ly mat@@ ch their cont@@ ribut@@ ion.
So par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ic@@ es.
And I think it makes the world look like this.
[@@ And l@@ ast@@ ly, for all eter@@ n@@ ity, F@@ ren@@ ch, b@@ le@@ u che@@ es@@ e, or ran@@ ch@@ ?@@ ]
You really want to get the deci@@ sion right if it's for all eter@@ n@@ ity, right?
You don't want to pic@@ k the wrong mut@@ ual fun@@ d, or the wrong sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing.
So that's one effec@@ t. The second eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s and make a cho@@ ice, we end up less s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed with the resul@@ t of the cho@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ w@@ er op@@ tions to cho@@ ose fro@@ m.
And there are sever@@ al reas@@ ons for this.
One of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dre@@ s@@ sing@@ s to cho@@ ose fro@@ m, if you buy one, and it's not perf@@ ect -- and what sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ing is@@ ? -- it's easy to imagine you could have made a different cho@@ ice that would have been bet@@ ter. And what happens is this imag@@ ined altern@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de, and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ trac@@ ts from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the deci@@ sion you ma@@ de,
even if it was a good decision@@ .
The more op@@ tions there are, the easi@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ os@@ e.
Secon@@ d, what economi@@ sts call "@@ opportun@@ ity cost@@ s."
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this mor@@ ning of talking about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things depen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to.
Well, when there are lots of altern@@ ati@@ ves to consider@@ , it is easy to imagine the attr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ atu@@ res of altern@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ jec@@ t that make you less s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed with the altern@@ ative that you've ch@@ os@@ en.
Here's an exampl@@ e. [@@ I can't stop thinking about those other avail@@ able par@@ king spac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et@@ ] S@@ or@@ ry if you're not New Yor@@ k@@ ers.
Here's what you're sup@@ posed to be thin@@ k@@ ing.
Here's this couple on the H@@ am@@ pt@@ on@@ s.
Ver@@ y ex@@ pensi@@ ve real est@@ ate.
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach@@ . Be@@ auti@@ ful day. They have it all to them@@ selv@@ es.
What could be bet@@ ter@@ ? "Well, dam@@ n it@@ ," this guy is thin@@ king,
"@@ It's Au@@ gu@@ st. Every@@ body in my Man@@ h@@ att@@ an neighbor@@ ho@@ od is a@@ way.
I could be par@@ king right in front of my build@@ ing@@ ."
And he sp@@ end@@ s two wee@@ ks n@@ agg@@ ed by the idea that he is mi@@ ss@@ ing the opportun@@ ity, day after day, to have a great par@@ king spac@@ e.
O@@ p@@ port@@ un@@ ity cost@@ s sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we cho@@ os@@ e, even when what we cho@@ ose is terri@@ fic@@ .
And the more op@@ tions there are to consider@@ , the more attr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ atu@@ res of these op@@ tions are going to be re@@ fl@@ ected by us as opportun@@ ity cost@@ s.
Here's another exampl@@ e.
Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of point@@ s.
It makes point@@ s about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things s@@ low@@ ly.
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you're cho@@ os@@ ing one thing, you're cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have lots of attr@@ ac@@ tive fe@@ atu@@ re@@ s, and it's going to make what you're doing less attr@@ ac@@ tiv@@ e.
Th@@ ir@@ d@@ : es@@ cal@@ ation of exp@@ ect@@ ations.
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ an@@ s.
I we@@ ar j@@ e@@ ans almost all the time.
There was a time when j@@ e@@ ans came in one f@@ lavor@@ , and you b@@ ou@@ ght them, and they f@@ it like c@@ rap@@ , they were incredi@@ bly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able, if you wor@@ e them and was@@ h@@ ed them enough tim@@ es, they started to feel OK@@ .
I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old on@@ es, and I said, "I want a pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ an@@ s. Here's my si@@ z@@ e."
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ per said, "D@@ o you want sli@@ m f@@ it, easy f@@ it, re@@ la@@ x@@ ed f@@ it?
You want b@@ utt@@ on f@@ ly or zi@@ p@@ per fl@@ y? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ was@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ was@@ h@@ ed@@ ?
Do you want them dist@@ re@@ s@@ se@@ d@@ ?
You want boo@@ t c@@ ut, ta@@ per@@ ed, bl@@ a@@ h bl@@ ah@@ ." On and on he w@@ ent.
My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ pp@@ ed. And after I re@@ cover@@ ed, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kin@@ d@@ ." He had no idea what that was, so I spent an h@@ our trying on all these dam@@ n j@@ e@@ an@@ s, and I wal@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- tru@@ th@@ ! -- with the b@@ est@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting j@@ e@@ ans I had ever h@@ ad.
I did bet@@ ter. All this cho@@ ice made it possible for me to do bet@@ ter.
But -- I felt wor@@ se.
Wh@@ y? I wro@@ te a whole book to try to ex@@ pla@@ in this to my@@ self.
The reason -- The reason I felt wor@@ se is that, with all of these op@@ tions avail@@ able, my exp@@ ect@@ ations about how good a pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans should be went up.
I had very low@@ , no particular exp@@ ect@@ ations when they only came in one f@@ lavor@@ . When they came in 100 f@@ lavor@@ s, dam@@ n it, one of them sh@@ oul@@ d@@ 've been perf@@ ec@@ t.
And what I got was go@@ od, but it wasn't perf@@ ec@@ t.
And so I compar@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ect@@ ed, and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing in compar@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ect@@ ed.
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to peopl@@ e's lives can't help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ect@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will b@@ e.
And what that's going to produce is less s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with re@@ sult@@ s, even when they're good re@@ sult@@ s.
No@@ body in the world of market@@ ing know@@ s this.
[@@ It all looks so great@@ . I can't wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ed@@ .@@ ] Because if they di@@ d, you wouldn't all know what this was ab@@ out.
The tr@@ ut@@ h is more like this.
[@@ Every@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se@@ ] The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se, it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a pl@@ eas@@ ant surpri@@ se.
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ a@@ ys, the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent, industri@@ ali@@ zed citi@@ z@@ en@@ s, with perf@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ect@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to b@@ e.
You will never be pl@@ eas@@ ant@@ ly surpri@@ sed because your exp@@ ect@@ ations, my exp@@ ect@@ ations, have gone through the ro@@ of@@ .
The se@@ cre@@ t to happ@@ in@@ ess -- this is what you all came for -- the se@@ cre@@ t to happ@@ in@@ ess is low exp@@ ect@@ ations. I want to say --
just a little auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ f@@ e, and sh@@ e's really quite wonder@@ ful@@ .
I couldn't have done bet@@ ter.
I didn't sett@@ le. But sett@@ ling isn't always such a bad thing.
F@@ in@@ ally -- One con@@ sequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of j@@ e@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed, and you ask wh@@ y,
who's responsi@@ ble, the answer is clear@@ : the world is responsi@@ ble.
What could you do?
When there are hundreds of different st@@ y@@ les of j@@ e@@ ans avail@@ able, and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing, and you ask wh@@ y, who's responsi@@ b@@ le@@ ? It is equ@@ ally cle@@ ar that the answer to the question is "@@ you@@ ."
You could have done bet@@ ter.
W@@ ith a h@@ und@@ red different kinds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ pla@@ y, there is no ex@@ c@@ use for fail@@ u@@ re.
And so when people make decision@@ s, and even though the resul@@ ts of the decision@@ s are go@@ od, they feel dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ed about them@@ ; they bl@@ ame them@@ selv@@ es.
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pressi@@ on has exp@@ lo@@ ded in the industri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation.
I believe a signific@@ ant -- not the on@@ ly, but a signific@@ ant -- cont@@ ribut@@ or to this exp@@ lo@@ sion of de@@ pressi@@ on, and also su@@ ic@@ ide@@ , is that people have experi@@ ences that are dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so high@@ ,
and then when they have to ex@@ pla@@ in these experi@@ ences to them@@ selv@@ es, they think they're at fa@@ ul@@ t.
And so the net resul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al, objec@@ tiv@@ ely, and we feel wor@@ se.
So let me re@@ mind you.
This is the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma, the one that we all take to be tru@@ e, and it's all fal@@ se. It is not tru@@ e.
There's no question that some cho@@ ice is better than n@@ one, but it doesn't foll@@ ow from that that more cho@@ ice is better than some cho@@ ice.
There's some mag@@ ical amoun@@ t. I don't know what it is.
I'm pretty con@@ fi@@ dent that we have long since pass@@ ed the point where op@@ tions im@@ prove our w@@ el@@ fare.
Now, as a pol@@ ic@@ y matter -- I'm almost done -- as a pol@@ ic@@ y mat@@ ter, the thing to think about is this@@ :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this cho@@ ice in industri@@ al societ@@ ies is materi@@ al aff@@ lu@@ ence.
There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about sever@@ al of them, where their problem is not that they have too much cho@@ ice.
Th@@ e@@ ir problem is that they have too litt@@ le.
So the stuff I'm talking about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of moder@@ n, aff@@ lu@@ ent, W@@ ester@@ n societ@@ i@@ es.
And what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this@@ : St@@ eve L@@ evit@@ t talked to you y@@ ester@@ day about how these ex@@ pensi@@ ve and difficul@@ t@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all child se@@ at@@ s don't hel@@ p.
What I'm telling you is that these ex@@ pensi@@ ve, complic@@ ated cho@@ ices -- it's not simply that they don't hel@@ p.
They actually h@@ ur@@ t.
They actually make us wor@@ se off@@ .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our societ@@ ies to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shi@@ ft@@ ed to societ@@ ies in which people have too few op@@ tion@@ s, not only would those peopl@@ e's lives be im@@ pro@@ ved@@ , but our@@ s would be improv@@ ed al@@ so,
which is what economi@@ sts call a "@@ Par@@ et@@ o-@@ improv@@ ing mo@@ ve@@ ."
In@@ come re@@ distribu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ c@@ ess cho@@ ice pl@@ agu@@ es us.
So to conclu@@ de. [@@ You can be anything you want to be -- no limit@@ s@@ ]
You're sup@@ posed to read this car@@ to@@ on, and, being a so@@ ph@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated person@@ , say, "A@@ h@@ ! What does this fish know@@ ?
You know, nothing is possible in this fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ ."
Im@@ pover@@ i@@ shed imag@@ in@@ ation, a my@@ o@@ pi@@ c view of the world --
and that's the way I read it at fir@@ st.
The more I thought about it, ho@@ we@@ ver, the more I came to the view that this fish know@@ s some@@ thing.
Because the tr@@ ut@@ h of the matter is that if you sh@@ att@@ er the fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possi@@ ble, you don't have free@@ do@@ m. You have par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s.
If you sh@@ att@@ er this fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possi@@ ble, you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion.
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ y@@ si@@ s, and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion.
Every@@ body needs a fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l@@ .
This one is almost certa@@ inly too limit@@ ed -- perhaps even for the fish@@ , certa@@ inly for us.
But the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ pe for mi@@ ser@@ y, and, I s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ t, disa@@ st@@ er.
Thank you very much.

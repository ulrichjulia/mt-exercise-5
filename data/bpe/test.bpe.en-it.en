S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED@@ , P@@ et@@ er S@@ kill@@ man intro@@ duc@@ ed a design chall@@ en@@ ge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challeng@@ e.
And the ide@@ a@@ 's pretty simpl@@ e:
T@@ e@@ am@@ s of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ stand@@ ing structure out of 20 stic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti@@ , one y@@ ard of t@@ ap@@ e, one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on to@@ p.
An@@ d, though it seems really simpl@@ e, it's actually pretty hard because it forc@@ es people to collabor@@ ate very quick@@ ly.
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea, and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design work@@ sh@@ op@@ .
And it was a huge succ@@ ess.
And since then, I've con@@ duc@@ ted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ op@@ s across the world with students and design@@ ers and architec@@ ts, even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the F@@ ort@@ un@@ e 5@@ 0,
and there's something about this ex@@ erci@@ se that re@@ ve@@ als very de@@ ep les@@ son@@ s about the nature of collabor@@ ation, and I'd like to share some of them with you.
So, norm@@ ally, most people beg@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing them@@ selves to the tas@@ k.
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like, they j@@ oc@@ key for pow@@ er. Then they spend some time pl@@ ann@@ ing, organiz@@ ing,
they sk@@ et@@ ch and they la@@ y out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti@@ .
They spend the maj@@ or@@ ity of their time as@@ sem@@ bl@@ ing the stic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ growing structu@@ re@@ s. And then fin@@ ally, just as they're run@@ ning out of time, someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on to@@ p, and then they st@@ and bac@@ k, and -- ta@@ -@@ da@@ ! --
they ad@@ mi@@ re their work.
But what really happen@@ s, most of the time, is that the "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " turns into an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ ," because the we@@ ight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low caus@@ es the entire structure to b@@ uc@@ k@@ le and to coll@@ ap@@ se.
So there are a number of people who have a lot more "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " moment@@ s than other@@ s, and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are re@@ cent gradu@@ ates of business school@@ .
They li@@ e, they che@@ at, they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame structu@@ re@@ s.
And of course there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " structu@@ re@@ s, and am@@ ong the best are re@@ cent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ g@@ art@@ en.
And it's pretty amaz@@ ing.
As P@@ et@@ er tell@@ s us, not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structu@@ re@@ s, but they're the most interesting structu@@ res of them all.
So the question you want to ask is@@ : How com@@ e? Wh@@ y? What is it about them@@ ?
And P@@ et@@ er li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pag@@ h@@ etti@@ , In@@ c@@ . Ri@@ ght@@ ?
They don't spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for pow@@ er.
But there's another reason as well.
And the reason is that business students are tra@@ ined to find the single right plan@@ , right?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it.
And then what happens is, when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the to@@ p, they run out of time and what hap@@ pens@@ ?
It's a cri@@ si@@ s.
So@@ und famili@@ ar@@ ? Ri@@ ght.
What kin@@ der@@ g@@ art@@ en@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ , and they build proto@@ ty@@ p@@ es, successi@@ ve proto@@ ty@@ p@@ es, always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on to@@ p, so they have multi@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they build proto@@ ty@@ p@@ es along the way.
D@@ es@@ ign@@ ers recogni@@ ze this type of collabor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative proc@@ ess.
And with each ver@@ sion@@ , kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what works and what doesn't work.
So the capac@@ ity to play in proto@@ type is really ess@@ enti@@ al, but let's look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form@@ .
So the aver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ch@@ es@@ ; business school@@ s student@@ s, about half of that@@ ; law@@ y@@ ers, a little bet@@ ter, but not much better than that, kin@@ der@@ g@@ art@@ ener@@ s, better than most adul@@ ts.
W@@ ho does the very b@@ est@@ ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ts and engine@@ ers, th@@ an@@ k@@ full@@ y.
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ch@@ es is the t@@ all@@ est structure I've se@@ en.
And why is it? Because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ infor@@ c@@ ing ge@@ omet@@ ric@@ al patter@@ ns are the key to building st@@ able structu@@ re@@ s.
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s, a little bit better than aver@@ age,
but here's where it gets interest@@ ing.
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ve ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am@@ , they get signific@@ ant@@ ly bet@@ ter.
It's incredi@@ ble. You know, you look aro@@ und, you go, "O@@ h, that te@@ am@@ 's going to win@@ ." You can just tell befor@@ e@@ hand@@ . And why is that?
Because they have speci@@ al s@@ kill@@ s of facil@@ it@@ ation.
They man@@ age the proc@@ ess, they understand the proc@@ ess.
And any team who manag@@ es and pa@@ ys close att@@ ention to work will signific@@ ant@@ ly im@@ prove the te@@ am@@ 's performan@@ ce.
S@@ pe@@ ci@@ ali@@ zed s@@ kill@@ s and facil@@ it@@ ation s@@ kill@@ s are the combin@@ ation that lead@@ s to str@@ ong succ@@ ess.
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form@@ , you'll get maybe six or so that have stand@@ ing structu@@ re@@ s.
And I tried something interest@@ ing.
I thought, let's up the ante, on@@ ce.
So I off@@ ered a 10@@ ,000 doll@@ ar pri@@ ze of software to the win@@ ning te@@ am@@ .
So what do you think happened to these design student@@ s?
What was the re@@ sult@@ ?
Here's what happen@@ ed@@ :
Not one team had a stand@@ ing structu@@ re.
If any@@ one had buil@@ t, say, a one in@@ ch structu@@ re, they would have taken home the pri@@ z@@ e.
So, isn't that interest@@ ing@@ ? That high st@@ ak@@ es have a str@@ ong imp@@ ac@@ t.
We did the ex@@ erci@@ se again with the same student@@ s.
What do you think happened th@@ en@@ ?
So now they understand the val@@ ue of proto@@ ty@@ p@@ ing.
So the same team went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very b@@ est@@ .
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est structu@@ res in the least amount of time.
So there's de@@ ep les@@ son@@ s for us about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and succ@@ ess. So, you might as@@ k@@ : Why would any@@ one actually spend time writ@@ ing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low chall@@ en@@ ge@@ ?
And the reason is, I help create digit@@ al tool@@ s and proc@@ es@@ ses to help te@@ am@@ s build car@@ s and video gam@@ es and visu@@ al effec@@ ts.
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low chall@@ en@@ ge does is it hel@@ ps them identi@@ f@@ y the hi@@ d@@ den as@@ sum@@ pt@@ ions.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use, f@@ ran@@ k@@ ly, every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ , doesn't it?
The chall@@ en@@ ge pro@@ vide@@ s a shar@@ ed experi@@ ence, a common langu@@ age, a common st@@ ance to build the right proto@@ ty@@ p@@ e.
And so, this is the val@@ ue of the experi@@ ence, of this so simple ex@@ erci@@ se.
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ com@@ .
It's a blo@@ g that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ s.
There's ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this.
There are cra@@ z@@ y exampl@@ es from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system.
There's world recor@@ ds that are on this as well.
And the fundament@@ al les@@ son@@ , I believ@@ e, is that design tr@@ ul@@ y is a cont@@ act sport@@ .
It de@@ man@@ ds that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the tas@@ k, and that we ap@@ ply the very best of our thin@@ king, our feeling and our doing to the chall@@ en@@ ge that we have at hand@@ .
And somet@@ im@@ es, a little proto@@ type of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "@@ u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h@@ " moment to a "@@ ta@@ -@@ da@@ " moment@@ .
And that can make a big differ@@ ence.
Thank you very much.
Let's pre@@ ten@@ d right here we have a mach@@ ine. A big mach@@ ine, a co@@ ol@@ , TED@@ -@@ ish mach@@ ine, and it's a time mach@@ ine.
And everyone in this room has to get into it.
And you can go back@@ war@@ ds, you can go for@@ war@@ d@@ s@@ ; you cannot sta@@ y where you are.
And I won@@ der what you@@ 'd cho@@ os@@ e, because I've been as@@ king my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go bac@@ k.
I don't know. They want to go back before there were auto@@ mo@@ bi@@ les or T@@ wit@@ ter or "@@ American I@@ dol@@ ."
I don't know.
I'm conv@@ inc@@ ed that there's some sort of pul@@ l to nost@@ al@@ gi@@ a, to wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
And I understand that.
I'm not part of that cro@@ w@@ d, I have to sa@@ y.
I don't want to go bac@@ k, and it's not because I'm ad@@ vent@@ uro@@ us. It's because possibilit@@ ies on this plan@@ et, they don't go bac@@ k, they go for@@ war@@ d.
So I want to get in the mach@@ ine, and I want to go for@@ war@@ d.
This is the great@@ est time there's ever been on this planet by any meas@@ ure that you w@@ ish to cho@@ o@@ se: heal@@ th, we@@ al@@ th, mo@@ bilit@@ y, opportun@@ ity, de@@ clin@@ ing rat@@ es of dise@@ ase ...
There's never been a time like this.
My great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents di@@ ed, all of them, by the time they were 6@@ 0.
My grand@@ parents p@@ ush@@ ed that number to 7@@ 0.
My parents are clo@@ sing in on 8@@ 0.
So there better be a n@@ ine at the beginning of my de@@ ath number@@ .
But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigg@@ er deal than that.
A ki@@ d bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can exp@@ ect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago.
Th@@ in@@ k about that, it's an incredible fac@@ t.
And why is it tru@@ e?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x@@ . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x kill@@ ed bill@@ ions of people on this plan@@ et.
It re@@ shap@@ ed the demo@@ graph@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever h@@ as.
It's g@@ one. It's v@@ ani@@ sh@@ ed.
We v@@ an@@ qui@@ shed it. Pu@@ ff@@ .
In the ric@@ h world, diseas@@ es that thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a gener@@ ation ago no longer exist@@ , har@@ d@@ ly.
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia, ru@@ bell@@ a, pol@@ io ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are@@ ?
V@@ acc@@ in@@ es, moder@@ n medic@@ ine, our ability to fe@@ ed bill@@ ions of people, those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scienti@@ fic me@@ th@@ od.
And to my min@@ d, the scienti@@ fic me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out, seeing if it work@@ s, chang@@ ing it when it doesn't -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity.
So that's the good new@@ s.
Un@@ fortunat@@ ely, that's all the good news because there are some other problem@@ s, and they've been ment@@ ion@@ ed many tim@@ es. And one of them is that de@@ sp@@ ite all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ment@@ s, a billion people go to bed hun@@ gr@@ y in this world every day.
That number@@ 's ris@@ ing, and it's ris@@ ing really rapid@@ ly, and it's dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful@@ .
And not only that, we've used our imag@@ in@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tras@@ h this glob@@ e.
Pot@@ able wat@@ er, ar@@ able land@@ , ra@@ infor@@ est@@ s, o@@ il@@ , g@@ as@@ : they're going a@@ way, and they're going away so@@ on, and un@@ less we innov@@ ate our way out of this mes@@ s, we're going away to@@ o.
So the question is@@ : Can we do that? And I think we can@@ .
I think it's cle@@ ar that we can make food that will fe@@ ed bill@@ ions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on.
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also dest@@ ro@@ y it.
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain@@ 't wi@@ sh@@ ful thin@@ k@@ ing.
But here's the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght@@ :
We've never needed progre@@ ss in science more than we need it right now. N@@ ever@@ . And we've also never been in a positi@@ on to de@@ plo@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can today.
We're on the ver@@ ge of amaz@@ ing, amazing ev@@ ents in many fiel@@ ds,
and yet I actually think we@@ 'd have to go back hundre@@ ds, 3@@ 00 years, before the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment, to find a time when we batt@@ led progre@@ s@@ s, when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly, on more fron@@ ts, than we do now.
People w@@ ra@@ p them@@ selves in their beli@@ ef@@ s, and they do it so ti@@ ght@@ ly that you can't set them fre@@ e.
Not even the tr@@ ut@@ h will set them fre@@ e.
An@@ d, list@@ en, every@@ on@@ e's ent@@ it@@ led to their op@@ in@@ ion@@ ; they're even ent@@ it@@ led to their op@@ ini@@ on about progre@@ s@@ s. But you know what you're not ent@@ it@@ led to@@ ?
You're not ent@@ it@@ led to your own fac@@ ts. S@@ or@@ r@@ y, you're no@@ t.
And this took me a@@ while to figure out.
A@@ b@@ out a dec@@ ade ago, I wro@@ te a story about vacc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ k@@ er. A little story.
And I was amaz@@ ed to find op@@ posit@@ ion@@ : op@@ positi@@ on to what is, after all, the most effec@@ tive public health meas@@ ure in human histor@@ y.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do@@ : I wro@@ te a story and I mov@@ ed on.
And so@@ on after that, I wro@@ te a story about genet@@ ically engine@@ ered fo@@ od.
S@@ ame thing, only bigg@@ er.
People were going cra@@ z@@ y.
So I wro@@ te a story about that to@@ o, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was "@@ Fran@@ k@@ en@@ fo@@ od@@ s@@ ," why they thought moving molec@@ ul@@ es around in a speci@@ fic@@ , rather than a hap@@ h@@ az@@ ard way, was tre@@ sp@@ ass@@ ing on natu@@ re@@ 's gro@@ und.
B@@ ut, you know, I do what I do. I wro@@ te the stor@@ y, I mov@@ ed on.
I mean, I'm a jour@@ n@@ alist@@ . We ty@@ p@@ e, we fil@@ e, we go to din@@ n@@ er. It's fin@@ e.
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me, and I couldn't figure out wh@@ y, and ev@@ entu@@ ally I di@@ d.
And that's because those f@@ an@@ at@@ ics that were driv@@ ing me cra@@ z@@ y w@@ er@@ en't actually f@@ an@@ at@@ ics at all.
They were thou@@ ght@@ ful people, educ@@ ated people, de@@ cent people.
They were exactly like the people in this room@@ .
And it just dist@@ urb@@ ed me so much.
But then I thought, you know, let's be hon@@ est@@ . We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relation@@ ship to progre@@ ss that we used to.
We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ent@@ ly.
We talk about it in i@@ ron@@ ic terms with little qu@@ ot@@ es around it@@ : "@@ progre@@ ss@@ ." Oka@@ y, there are reas@@ ons for that, and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are.
We've lost fa@@ ith in inst@@ itut@@ ions, in auth@@ or@@ ity, and sometimes in science it@@ self, and there's no reason we sh@@ ouldn't hav@@ e.
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will understand@@ .
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l@@ , B@@ hop@@ al, the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er, Vi@@ ox@@ x, we@@ ap@@ ons of mas@@ s de@@ struc@@ tion, h@@ ang@@ ing ch@@ ad@@ s.
You know, you can cho@@ ose your list@@ .
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right,
so be s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ic@@ al.
A@@ s@@ k question@@ s, de@@ m@@ and pro@@ of@@ , de@@ m@@ and evid@@ ence.
Don@@ 't take anything for gr@@ ant@@ ed.
But here's the thing@@ : When you get pro@@ of@@ , you need to acc@@ ep@@ t the pro@@ of@@ , and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epide@@ mi@@ c of fe@@ ar like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
A@@ b@@ out 12 years ago, there was a story publi@@ sh@@ ed, a hor@@ ri@@ ble stor@@ y, that lin@@ ked the epide@@ mi@@ c of auti@@ s@@ m to the meas@@ l@@ es, m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ bell@@ a vacc@@ ine sh@@ ot@@ .
Ver@@ y scar@@ y.
T@@ ons of studi@@ es were done to see if this was tru@@ e.
T@@ ons of studi@@ es should have been don@@ e; it's a seri@@ ous issu@@ e.
The data came bac@@ k.
The data came back from the United Stat@@ es, from En@@ g@@ land@@ , from S@@ w@@ ed@@ en, from Can@@ ad@@ a, and it was all the s@@ am@@ e: no cor@@ rel@@ ation, no connec@@ tion, n@@ one at all.
It doesn't mat@@ ter. It doesn't matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ t@@ es, we believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel re@@ al.
We don't believe a bun@@ ch of docu@@ ments from a government off@@ ici@@ al giving us dat@@ a, and I do understand that, I think we all do.
But you know what@@ ?
The resul@@ t of that has been disa@@ st@@ ro@@ us.
Di@@ sa@@ st@@ ro@@ us because here's a fac@@ t@@ : The United St@@ ates is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine r@@ ate for meas@@ les is going dow@@ n.
That is dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful, and we should be ash@@ am@@ ed of our@@ selv@@ es.
It's hor@@ ri@@ ble.
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that?
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use, did any@@ one have meas@@ les her@@ e?
H@@ as one person in this audi@@ ence ever seen someone die of meas@@ les@@ ?
Do@@ es@@ n't happen very much.
Do@@ es@@ n't happen in this country at all, but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 times in the world last year.
That's a lot of de@@ ath of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour@@ .
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our min@@ ds, and people like J@@ enn@@ y Mc@@ Car@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mess@@ ages of fe@@ ar and ill@@ it@@ er@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ form@@ s like "O@@ p@@ ra@@ h@@ " and "@@ L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve@@ ."
And they can do it because they don't lin@@ k caus@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation.
They don't understand that these things see@@ m the s@@ am@@ e, but they're almost never the s@@ am@@ e.
And it's something we need to lear@@ n, and we need to learn it really so@@ on.
This guy was a her@@ o, J@@ on@@ as S@@ al@@ k.
He took one of the wor@@ st sco@@ ur@@ g@@ es of man@@ kind away from us.
No f@@ ear@@ , no ag@@ on@@ y. P@@ ol@@ io -- pu@@ ff@@ , g@@ one.
That guy in the midd@@ le, not so much.
H@@ is name is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it.
He just developed a ro@@ tav@@ ir@@ us vacc@@ ine with a bun@@ ch of other people.
It@@ 'll s@@ ave the lives of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 kids in the developing world every year.
P@@ re@@ tty go@@ od, right?
Well, it's go@@ od, ex@@ ce@@ pt that P@@ au@@ l goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valu@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing.
And he actually says it that way.
So, Pa@@ ul@@ 's a terrori@@ st.
When P@@ au@@ l spe@@ a@@ ks in a public hear@@ ing, he can't test@@ i@@ f@@ y without ar@@ m@@ ed guard@@ s.
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school@@ .
And wh@@ y? Because P@@ au@@ l made a vacc@@ ine.
I don't need to say this, but vacc@@ ines are ess@@ enti@@ al.
You take them a@@ way, dise@@ ase comes bac@@ k, hor@@ ri@@ ble diseas@@ es. And that's happen@@ ing.
We have meas@@ les in this country now.
And it's getting wor@@ se, and pretty so@@ on kids are going to die of it again because it's just a number@@ s gam@@ e.
And they're not just going to die of meas@@ l@@ es.
What about poli@@ o? Let's have that. Why not@@ ?
A colleg@@ e class@@ m@@ ate of min@@ e wro@@ te me a couple wee@@ ks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent@@ .
No on@@ e's ever said that befor@@ e.
She wasn't going to vacc@@ inate her ki@@ d against poli@@ o,
no way.
F@@ ine.
Wh@@ y? Because we don't have poli@@ o. And you know what@@ ?
We didn't have pol@@ io in this country y@@ ester@@ day.
To@@ day, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plan@@ e in L@@ ag@@ os this mor@@ n@@ ing, and he's fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X@@ , right now he's over O@@ hi@@ o.
And he's going to land in a couple of hour@@ s, he's going to r@@ ent a car@@ , and he's going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach@@ , and he's going to att@@ end one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED din@@ n@@ ers t@@ oni@@ ght.
And he doesn't know that he's inf@@ ected with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic diseas@@ e, and we don't ei@@ ther because that's the way the world work@@ s.
That's the planet we live on. Don@@ 't pre@@ ten@@ d it is@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now, we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in li@@ es. We love to do it.
Every@@ one take their vit@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ n@@ ing@@ ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ace@@ a, a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you go@@ ing.
I know you did because half of Americ@@ ans do every day.
They take the stuff@@ , and they take altern@@ ative medic@@ in@@ es, and it doesn't matter how often we find out that they're us@@ el@@ ess.
The data says it all the time.
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine. They almost never do more than that.
It's o@@ ka@@ y, you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dar@@ k ur@@ in@@ e? I'm tot@@ ally with you.
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ ine. D@@ ar@@ k.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well, I think I underst@@ and, we h@@ ate Bi@@ g P@@ har@@ ma.
We h@@ ate Bi@@ g Go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment. We don't tr@@ ust the M@@ an.
And we sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t@@ : Our health care system su@@ c@@ ks.
It's cru@@ el to millions of people.
It's absolutely ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing@@ ly co@@ ld and s@@ oul@@ -@@ b@@ ending to those of us who can even af@@ for@@ d it.
So we run away from it, and where do we run@@ ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ace@@ b@@ o.
That's fantast@@ ic. I love Bi@@ g P@@ l@@ ace@@ b@@ o.
B@@ ut, you know, it's really a seri@@ ous thing because this stuff is c@@ rap@@ , and we spend bill@@ ions of dollars on it.
And I have all sort@@ s of little pro@@ ps here.
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ go, fra@@ u@@ d@@ ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ace@@ a, fra@@ u@@ d@@ ; ac@@ ai -- I don't even know what that is but we're sp@@ ending bill@@ ions of dollars on it -- it's fra@@ u@@ d.
And you know what@@ ? When I say this stuff@@ , people scre@@ am at me, and they say, "@@ What do you car@@ e? Let people do what they want to do.
It makes them feel go@@ od@@ ."
And you know what@@ ? You're wron@@ g.
Because I don't care if it's the se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who's say@@ ing, "@@ H@@ m@@ m, I'm not going to take the evid@@ ence of my exper@@ ts on mam@@ mo@@ gram@@ s@@ ," or some cancer qu@@ ack who want@@ s to tre@@ at his pati@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ ee en@@ em@@ as.
When you start down the ro@@ ad where beli@@ e@@ f and mag@@ ic re@@ place evid@@ ence and sci@@ ence, you end up in a place you don't want to b@@ e.
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i South Africa.
He kill@@ ed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ sist@@ ing that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot@@ , gar@@ li@@ c and l@@ em@@ on o@@ il were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of A@@ ID@@ S.
H@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of need@@ less de@@ ath@@ s in a country that has been pl@@ agu@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this diseas@@ e.
P@@ le@@ as@@ e, don't tell me there are no con@@ sequ@@ ences to these things.
There are. There always are.
Now, the most min@@ d@@ less epide@@ mi@@ c we're in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d batt@@ le between pro@@ pon@@ ents of genet@@ ically engine@@ ered food and the organi@@ c el@@ it@@ e.
It's an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic deb@@ ate. It has to stop@@ .
It's a deb@@ ate about wor@@ ds, about met@@ ap@@ hor@@ s.
It's ide@@ olog@@ y, it's not sci@@ ence.
E@@ very single thing we e@@ at, every gra@@ in of ric@@ e, every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y, every B@@ r@@ us@@ sel@@ s s@@ pro@@ ut has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man@@ .
You know, there w@@ er@@ en't t@@ ang@@ er@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ den@@ .
There wasn't any c@@ ant@@ al@@ ou@@ p@@ e.
There w@@ er@@ en't Chri@@ st@@ m@@ as tre@@ es. We made it all.
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years.
And some of it work@@ ed, and some of it di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that di@@ d@@ n@@ '@@ t.
Now we can do it in a more preci@@ se way --
and there are ris@@ ks, absolutely --
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in A into ric@@ e, and that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, pro@@ long their liv@@ es.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
We objec@@ t to genet@@ ically engine@@ ered fo@@ od.
Why do we do that?
Well, the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly hear are@@ : To@@ o many chem@@ ic@@ als, p@@ est@@ ic@@ ide@@ s, hor@@ mon@@ es, mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, we don't want gi@@ ant fiel@@ ds of the same thing, that's wron@@ g.
We don't companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life.
We don't want companies ow@@ ning se@@ ed@@ s.
And you know what my respon@@ se to all of that is@@ ?
Y@@ es, you're right. Let's fi@@ x it.
It's tru@@ e, we've got a huge food problem@@ , but this isn't sci@@ ence.
This has nothing to do with sci@@ ence.
It's law@@ , it's mor@@ al@@ ity, it's pat@@ ent stuff@@ .
You know science isn't a comp@@ an@@ y.
It's not a countr@@ y.
It's not even an ide@@ a@@ ; it's a proc@@ ess.
It's a proc@@ ess, and sometimes it works and sometimes it does@@ n@@ '@@ t, but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're af@@ rai@@ d, is really very de@@ ad@@ en@@ ing, and it's pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pro@@ sper@@ ing.
You know, in the next 50 years we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now, 70 percent@@ .
This invest@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years.
D@@ is@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful@@ . D@@ is@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful@@ .
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.
And wh@@ y? G@@ en@@ et@@ ically engine@@ ered fo@@ od.
We don't want to en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e people to e@@ at that ro@@ tt@@ en stuff@@ , like c@@ ass@@ ava for inst@@ ance.
C@@ ass@@ av@@ a@@ 's something that half a billion people e@@ at.
It's kind of like a pot@@ ato.
It's just a bun@@ ch of cal@@ ori@@ es. It su@@ c@@ ks.
It doesn't have nut@@ ri@@ ent@@ s, it doesn't have prote@@ in, and scientist@@ s are engine@@ ering all of that into it right now.
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they@@ 'd be able to not go bl@@ in@@ d.
They wouldn't star@@ ve, and you know what@@ ?
That would be n@@ ice. It wouldn't be C@@ he@@ z P@@ anis@@ se, but it would be n@@ ice.
And all I can say about this is@@ : Why are we fi@@ ght@@ ing it?
I mean, let's ask our@@ selv@@ es@@ : Why are we fi@@ ght@@ ing it?
Because we don't want to move gen@@ es aro@@ und@@ ?
This is about moving gen@@ es aro@@ und. It's not about chem@@ ic@@ als.
It's not about our ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous pas@@ sion for hor@@ mon@@ es, our in@@ sist@@ ence on having bigg@@ er fo@@ od, better fo@@ od, sing@@ ular fo@@ od.
This isn't about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es,
this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve, and it's about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant@@ .
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use, you know some@@ thing@@ ? If we don@@ '@@ t, if we continu@@ e to act the way we're act@@ ing, we're gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don't think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of@@ : high@@ -@@ tec@@ h col@@ oni@@ alis@@ m.
There's no other way to descri@@ be what's going on here.
It's sel@@ fish@@ , it's u@@ g@@ ly, it's bene@@ ath us, and we really have to stop it.
So after this amaz@@ ing@@ ly f@@ un convers@@ ation, you might want to say, "@@ So, you still want to get in this ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ous time mach@@ ine and go for@@ war@@ d@@ ?"
A@@ b@@ solut@@ el@@ y. A@@ b@@ solut@@ ely, I do.
It's st@@ uc@@ k in the present right now, but we have an amazing opportun@@ ity.
We can set that time mach@@ ine on anything we want@@ .
We can move it where we want to move it, and we're going to move it where we want to move it.
We have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think, but when we get in the time mach@@ ine and we go a@@ head@@ , we're going to be happy we do.
I know that we can@@ , and as far as I'm concer@@ ne@@ d, that's something the world needs right now.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
One day, Lo@@ s An@@ gel@@ es T@@ imes col@@ um@@ ni@@ st St@@ eve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was wal@@ king along the stre@@ ets of dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n Lo@@ s An@@ gel@@ es when he heard beautiful mus@@ ic.
And the source was a man, an Afric@@ an@@ -@@ American man, char@@ m@@ ing, ru@@ gg@@ ed, hom@@ el@@ ess, pla@@ ying a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ing@@ s.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because St@@ ev@@ e's col@@ um@@ ns became the basi@@ s for a boo@@ k, which was turned into a movi@@ e, with Ro@@ ber@@ t D@@ ow@@ ney J@@ r. ac@@ ting as St@@ eve L@@ op@@ e@@ z@@ , and J@@ am@@ i@@ e F@@ ox@@ x as N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers, the Ju@@ ill@@ i@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined dou@@ ble bas@@ si@@ st wh@@ ose pro@@ mi@@ sing care@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ ort by a tra@@ gi@@ c aff@@ l@@ ic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schi@@ z@@ op@@ h@@ ren@@ i@@ a.
N@@ ath@@ ani@@ el dro@@ pped out of Ju@@ ill@@ i@@ ar@@ d, he suff@@ ered a compl@@ ete bre@@ ak@@ dow@@ n, and 30 years lat@@ er he was living hom@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ ets of S@@ ki@@ d R@@ ow in dow@@ n@@ tow@@ n Lo@@ s An@@ gel@@ es.
I en@@ cou@@ rag@@ e all of you to read St@@ ev@@ e's book or to wat@@ ch the movi@@ e to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that form@@ ed between these two men@@ ,
I'm J@@ ane Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al. I'm a game design@@ er.
I've been making gam@@ es online now for 10 years, and my go@@ al for the next dec@@ ade is to try to make it as easy to s@@ ave the world in real life as it is to s@@ ave the world in online gam@@ es.
Now, I have a pl@@ an for this, and it ent@@ ail@@ s conv@@ inc@@ ing more people, inclu@@ ding all of you, to spend more time pla@@ ying bigg@@ er and better gam@@ es.
Ri@@ ght now we spend three billion hours a wee@@ k pla@@ ying online gam@@ es.
Some of you might be thin@@ king, "@@ That's a lot of time to spend pla@@ ying gam@@ es.
Ma@@ ybe too much time, consider@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent problems we have to solve in the real world@@ ."
But actually, accor@@ ding to my research at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re, actually the op@@ pos@@ ite is tru@@ e.
Th@@ re@@ e billion hours a wee@@ k is not ne@@ arly enough game play to solve the world's most ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.
In fact, I believe that if we want to sur@@ vive the next centur@@ y on this plan@@ et, we need to incre@@ ase that tot@@ al d@@ ram@@ at@@ ic@@ ally.
I've c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated the tot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every wee@@ k.
So, that's probably a bit of a coun@@ ter@@ -@@ intu@@ itive idea, so I'll say it again, let it sin@@ k in@@ :
If we want to solve problems like hun@@ g@@ er, povert@@ y, climate chang@@ e, global con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t, ob@@ es@@ ity, I believe that we need to as@@ pi@@ re to play gam@@ es online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a wee@@ k, by the end of the next deca@@ de. N@@ o. I'm seri@@ ous. I am@@ .
Here's wh@@ y. This picture pretty much sum@@ s up why I think gam@@ es are so ess@@ ential to the future sur@@ viv@@ al of the human speci@@ es. T@@ rul@@ y.
This is a port@@ ra@@ it by photograph@@ er Ph@@ il T@@ ol@@ ed@@ ano. He wanted to cap@@ ture the emo@@ tion of gam@@ ing,
so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were play@@ ing.
And this is a clas@@ sic gam@@ ing emot@@ ion.
Now, if you're not a gam@@ er, you might mi@@ ss some of the nu@@ ance in this ph@@ ot@@ o.
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ c@@ y, a little bit of f@@ ear@@ , but inten@@ se concentr@@ ation, de@@ ep@@ , de@@ ep fo@@ cus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem.
If you are a gam@@ er, you will not@@ ice a few nu@@ anc@@ es her@@ e: the c@@ rin@@ k@@ le of the ey@@ es up, and around the m@@ outh is a si@@ gn of op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sm@@ ,
and the ey@@ e@@ bro@@ w@@ s up is surpri@@ se.
This is a gam@@ er who's on the ver@@ ge of something called an "@@ epi@@ c win@@ ."
O@@ h, you've heard of that.
OK@@ , go@@ od, so we have some gam@@ ers am@@ ong us.
A@@ n epi@@ c w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily positi@@ ve, you had no idea it was even possible until you achi@@ ev@@ ed it.
It was almost bey@@ ond the thre@@ sh@@ old of imag@@ in@@ ation, and when you get there, you're sh@@ oc@@ ked to dis@@ cover what you're tr@@ ul@@ y cap@@ able of@@ . That's an epi@@ c w@@ in.
This is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c w@@ in.
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next centur@@ y -- the face of someone wh@@ o, against all od@@ ds, is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c w@@ in.
Now, un@@ fortunat@@ ely this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s.
This is what I call the "@@ I'm Not Go@@ od At Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e. This is actually me making it. Can you se@@ e? Y@@ es. Go@@ od.
This is me making the "@@ I'm Not Go@@ od At Li@@ fe@@ " fac@@ e.
This is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighbor@@ ho@@ od in Ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y, Californi@@ a, where I did my Ph@@ D on why we're better in gam@@ es than we are in real life.
And this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers hav@@ e. We feel that we are not as good in real@@ ity as we are in gam@@ es.
I don't mean just good as in success@@ ful, al@@ though that's part of it. We do achi@@ eve more in game world@@ s.
But I also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- inspi@@ red to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate.
And when we're in game worl@@ ds, I believe that many of us become the best ver@@ sion of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment@@ 's not@@ ice, the most likely to st@@ ick with a problem as long at it ta@@ k@@ es, to get up after fail@@ ure and try again.
And in real life, when we face fail@@ u@@ re, when we con@@ front ob@@ st@@ ac@@ l@@ es, we often don't feel that way. We feel over@@ com@@ e, we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed, we feel an@@ x@@ i@@ ous, maybe de@@ pres@@ se@@ d, fru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ n@@ ic@@ al.
We never have those feel@@ ings when we're pla@@ ying gam@@ es, they just don't ex@@ i@@ st in gam@@ es.
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a gradu@@ ate student@@ .
What about gam@@ es makes it im@@ possible to feel that we can't achi@@ eve every@@ thing@@ ?
How can we take those feel@@ ings from gam@@ es and ap@@ ply them to real@@ -@@ world work@@ ?
So I looked at gam@@ es like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t, which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative problem@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environ@@ ment.
And I started to not@@ ice a few things that make epi@@ c win@@ s so possible in online world@@ s.
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online gam@@ es, espe@@ ci@@ ally in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t, there are lots and lots of different char@@ ac@@ ters who are wi@@ lling to tr@@ ust you with a world@@ -@@ sav@@ ing missi@@ on, right a@@ way.
But not just any missi@@ on, it's a missi@@ on that is perf@@ ect@@ ly mat@@ ched with your curr@@ ent level in the gam@@ e.
Ri@@ ght@@ ? So you can do it.
They never give you a chall@@ en@@ ge you can't achi@@ ev@@ e.
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you're cap@@ able of@@ , so you have to try har@@ d.
But there's no un@@ em@@ plo@@ y@@ ment in World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft@@ ; no sitting aro@@ und, w@@ r@@ ing@@ ing your hand@@ s -- there's always something speci@@ fic and important to be don@@ e.
There are also t@@ ons of collabor@@ ator@@ s.
Every@@ where you go, hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achi@@ eve your epi@@ c missi@@ on.
That's not something we have in real life that easi@@ ly, this sense that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of collabor@@ ator@@ s.
And there's this epi@@ c stor@@ y, this inspi@@ r@@ ing story of why we're there, and what we're do@@ ing,
and we get all this positi@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ k.
You guys have heard of level@@ ing up, +@@ 1 str@@ eng@@ th, +@@ 1 intell@@ i@@ gen@@ ce.
We don't get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life.
When I get off this st@@ age, I'm not going to have +@@ 1 spe@@ ak@@ ing, and +@@ 1 cra@@ z@@ y idea, +@@ 20 cra@@ z@@ y idea.
I don't get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life.
Now, the problem with collabor@@ ative online environ@@ ments like World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft is that it's so s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c w@@ in all the time, we deci@@ de to spend all our time in these game world@@ s.
It's just better than real@@ ity.
So, so far@@ , collec@@ tiv@@ ely all the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the virtu@@ al problems of A@@ z@@ ero@@ th.
Now, that's not necess@@ ar@@ ily a bad thing.
It might sound like it's a bad thing. But to put that in cont@@ ext@@ : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est prim@@ ate human anc@@ est@@ ors sto@@ od up.
That was the first u@@ pri@@ ght pri@@ mat@@ e.
So when we talk about how much time we're curr@@ ently invest@@ ing in pla@@ ying gam@@ es, the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evol@@ ut@@ ion, which is an extra@@ ordin@@ ary thing. But it's also ap@@ t, because it turns out that by sp@@ ending all this time pla@@ ying gam@@ es, we're actually chang@@ ing what we are cap@@ able of as human be@@ ing@@ s. We're evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty speci@@ es.
This is tru@@ e. I believe this.
So, consi@@ der this really interesting stati@@ stic@@ ;
it was recent@@ ly publi@@ shed by a research@@ er at Car@@ ne@@ gi@@ e M@@ ell@@ on Uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ y:
The aver@@ age young person today in a country with a str@@ ong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10@@ ,000 hours pla@@ ying online gam@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1@@ .
Now 10@@ ,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reas@@ on@@ s.
F@@ ir@@ st of all, for children in the United Stat@@ es, 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school@@ , from fi@@ ft@@ h gra@@ de to high school gradu@@ ation, if you have perf@@ ect att@@ end@@ ance.
So, we have an entire par@@ all@@ el tr@@ ack of education going on, where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they're learning about everything else in school@@ .
Some of you have probably read M@@ al@@ col@@ m G@@ l@@ ad@@ well@@ 's new book "O@@ ut@@ li@@ er@@ s@@ ,"
so you would have heard of his the@@ ory of succ@@ ess, the "@@ 10@@ ,000 hour@@ s@@ " the@@ ory of succ@@ ess.
It's based on this great cogn@@ iti@@ ve@@ -@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 hours of ef@@ fort@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1, we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it.
We will be as good at whatever we do as the great@@ est people in the world.
And so, now what we're looking at is an entire gener@@ ation of young people who are virtu@@ oso gam@@ ers.
So, the big question is, "@@ What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at@@ ?"
Because if we could figure that out, we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ preced@@ ent@@ ed human re@@ source on our hand@@ s.
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying online gam@@ es.
These are our virtu@@ oso gam@@ ers,
500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily good at some@@ thing.
And in the next deca@@ de, we're going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ ar@@ ily good at whatever that is.
If you don't know it al@@ read@@ y, this is com@@ ing. The game industr@@ y is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ energy and that work with the wi@@ rel@@ ess phone net@@ works instead of bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Internet@@ , so that gam@@ ers all over the world, particul@@ arly in Indi@@ a, Ch@@ ina, Bra@@ z@@ il@@ , can get on@@ lin@@ e.
They exp@@ ect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next deca@@ de.
It will bring us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers.
So I've started to think about what these gam@@ es are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at.
Here are the four things I came up with@@ . The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mi@@ sm@@ .
OK@@ , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me self-@@ motiv@@ ation.
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m is the desi@@ re to act immediat@@ ely to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le, comb@@ ined with the beli@@ e@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of succ@@ ess.
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c w@@ in is possi@@ ble, and that it's always wor@@ th tr@@ y@@ ing, and trying now.
G@@ am@@ ers don't si@@ t aro@@ und.
G@@ am@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at we@@ av@@ ing a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ric@@ .
There's a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them, even if they've be@@ at@@ en us b@@ ad@@ ly.
And the reason is, it takes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a game with some@@ one. We tr@@ ust that they will spend their time with us, that they will play by the same rul@@ es, val@@ ue the same go@@ al, sta@@ y with the game until it's over@@ .
And so, pla@@ ying a game together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation.
And we actually build stron@@ g@@ er social relation@@ shi@@ ps as a resul@@ t.
B@@ li@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivit@@ y. I love it.
You know, there's a reason why the aver@@ age World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a wee@@ k -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time job@@ .
It's because we know, when we're pla@@ ying a gam@@ e, that we're actually hap@@ pi@@ er working hard than we are re@@ la@@ x@@ ing, or h@@ ang@@ ing out.
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed as human be@@ ing@@ s, to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work.
And gam@@ ers are wi@@ lling to work hard all the time, if they're given the right work.
F@@ in@@ all@@ y: epi@@ c mean@@ ing.
G@@ am@@ ers love to be att@@ ach@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspi@@ r@@ ing missi@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stori@@ es.
So, just one bit of tri@@ via that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ spec@@ ti@@ ve@@ :
So, you all know Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a, bigg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
Secon@@ d bigg@@ est wi@@ k@@ i in the world, with ne@@ arly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 art@@ ic@@ l@@ es, is the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i. Fi@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th.
They have compi@@ led more information about World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft on the Internet than any other to@@ pi@@ c cover@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world.
They are building an epi@@ c story.
They are building an epi@@ c knowled@@ ge re@@ source about the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ f@@ t.
Oka@@ y, so these are four super@@ pow@@ ers that ad@@ d up to one thing@@ :
G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed hop@@ e@@ ful individu@@ als.
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of chang@@ ing the world.
And the only problem is, they believe that they are cap@@ able of chang@@ ing virtu@@ al worl@@ ds and not the real world.
That's the problem that I'm trying to sol@@ ve.
There's an economi@@ st nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ stron@@ ov@@ a.
H@@ is work is brill@@ i@@ ant@@ . He looks at why people are invest@@ ing so much time and energy and money in online world@@ s.
And he says, "@@ We're wit@@ ness@@ ing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a mas@@ s ex@@ o@@ du@@ s to virtu@@ al worl@@ ds and online game environ@@ ment@@ s."
And he's an economi@@ st, so he's r@@ ation@@ al. And he says -- Not like me, I'm a game design@@ er@@ ; I'm ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant@@ .
But he says that this makes perf@@ ect sen@@ se, because gam@@ ers can achi@@ eve more in online worl@@ ds than they can in real life.
They can have stron@@ g@@ er social relation@@ shi@@ ps in gam@@ es than they can have in real li@@ fe@@ ;
they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in gam@@ es than they do in real life.
So he says, for now it makes perf@@ ect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtu@@ al worl@@ ds than the real world. Now, I also agre@@ e that that is r@@ ation@@ al, for now. But it is no@@ t, by any mean@@ s, an op@@ tim@@ al situ@@ ation. We have to start making the real world work more like a gam@@ e.
I take my inspi@@ r@@ ation from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago.
These are anci@@ ent dic@@ e, made out of she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nuc@@ k@@ l@@ es. Be@@ for@@ e we had aw@@ es@@ ome game controll@@ ers, we had she@@ ep@@ 's k@@ nuc@@ k@@ l@@ es. And these re@@ present the first game equi@@ p@@ ment design@@ ed by human be@@ ing@@ s,
and if you're famili@@ ar with the work of the anci@@ ent Gre@@ e@@ k hist@@ ori@@ an H@@ ero@@ do@@ t@@ us, you might know this histor@@ y,
which is the history of who invent@@ ed gam@@ es and wh@@ y.
H@@ ero@@ do@@ tu@@ s says that gam@@ es, particul@@ arly dice gam@@ es, were invent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ di@@ a, during a time of fam@@ ine.
A@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly, there was such a se@@ vere fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ dia decided they had to do something cra@@ z@@ y.
People were suff@@ er@@ ing. People were fi@@ ght@@ ing. It was an ex@@ tre@@ me situ@@ ation, they needed an ex@@ tre@@ me solut@@ ion.
So, accor@@ ding to H@@ ero@@ do@@ t@@ us, they invent@@ ed dice gam@@ es, and they set up a k@@ ing@@ do@@ m@@ -@@ wi@@ de pol@@ ic@@ y:
On one day, everybody would e@@ at,
and on the next day, everybody would play gam@@ es.
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in pla@@ ying the dice gam@@ es, because gam@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing, and im@@ mer@@ se us in such s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ y@@ ing, bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivit@@ y, they would ign@@ ore the fact that they had no food to e@@ at.
And then on the next day, they would play gam@@ es@@ ; and on the next day, they would e@@ at.
And accor@@ ding to H@@ ero@@ do@@ t@@ us, they pass@@ ed 18 years this way, sur@@ viv@@ ing through a fam@@ ine, by e@@ ating on one day, and pla@@ ying gam@@ es on the nex@@ t.
Now, this is exact@@ ly, I think, how we're using gam@@ es today. We're using gam@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e real@@ -@@ world suff@@ ering --
we're using gam@@ es to get away
from everything that's bro@@ ken in the real environ@@ ment, everything that's not s@@ ati@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life, and we're getting what we need from gam@@ es.
But it doesn't have to end there.
This is really excit@@ ing. Ac@@ cor@@ ding to H@@ ero@@ do@@ t@@ us, after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn't getting bet@@ ter, so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al dice gam@@ e.
They divi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in hal@@ f@@ . They play@@ ed one dice gam@@ e, and the win@@ n@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ u@@ re.
They would leave L@@ y@@ di@@ a, and they would go out in se@@ arch of a new place to liv@@ e, le@@ av@@ ing behind just enough people to sur@@ vive on the resourc@@ es that were avail@@ able, and hop@@ e@@ fully to take their civi@@ liz@@ ation some@@ where else where they could th@@ riv@@ e.
Now, this so@@ unds cra@@ z@@ y, right?
But recent@@ ly, DNA evid@@ ence has sh@@ own that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ can@@ s, who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ m@@ pi@@ re, actually share the same DNA as the anci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ an@@ s.
And so, recent@@ ly, scientist@@ s have sugg@@ est@@ ed that H@@ ero@@ do@@ t@@ us@@ ' cra@@ z@@ y story is actually tru@@ e.
And ge@@ ologi@@ sts have found evid@@ ence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that l@@ ast@@ ed for ne@@ arly 20 years, that could have expl@@ ain@@ ed the fam@@ ine.
So this cra@@ z@@ y story might be tru@@ e. They might have actually sav@@ ed their culture by pla@@ ying gam@@ es, es@@ cap@@ ing to gam@@ es for 18 years, and then been so inspi@@ re@@ d, and knew so much about how to come together with gam@@ es, that they actually sav@@ ed the entire civi@@ liz@@ ation that way.
Oka@@ y, we can do that.
We've been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft since 199@@ 4@@ .
That was the first real@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y game from the World of W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft seri@@ es. That was 1@@ 6 years ago.
They play@@ ed dice gam@@ es for 18 years, we've been pla@@ ying W@@ ar@@ cra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 years.
I say we are ready for our own epi@@ c gam@@ e.
Now, they had half the civi@@ liz@@ ation go off in se@@ arch of a new world,
so that's where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a wee@@ k of gam@@ e-@@ play fro@@ m.
Let's get half of us to agre@@ e to spend an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying gam@@ es, until we solve real@@ -@@ world problem@@ s.
Now, I know you're as@@ king, "@@ How are we going to solve real@@ -@@ world problems in gam@@ es@@ ?" Well, that's what I've de@@ vo@@ ted my work to over the past few years, at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re.
We have this b@@ ann@@ er in our off@@ ices in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to, and it ex@@ pres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the futu@@ re.
We do not want to try to predic@@ t the futu@@ re.
What we want to do is make the futu@@ re.
We want to imagine the b@@ est@@ -@@ case scen@@ ario out@@ com@@ e, and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a real@@ ity.
We want to imagine epi@@ c win@@ s, and then give people the means to achi@@ eve the epi@@ c w@@ in.
I'm just going to very bri@@ ef@@ ly show you three gam@@ es that I've made that are an att@@ em@@ pt to give people the means to create epi@@ c win@@ s in their own fut@@ ure@@ s.
This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il@@ .
We made this game in 200@@ 7@@ .
This is an online game in which you try to sur@@ vive an o@@ il sh@@ ort@@ age.
The o@@ il sh@@ ort@@ age is fic@@ tion@@ al, but we put enough online cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it's re@@ al, and to live your real life as if we've run out of o@@ il@@ . So when you come to the gam@@ e, you si@@ gn up, tell us where you liv@@ e, and then we give you real@@ -@@ time news vide@@ o@@ s, data fe@@ ed@@ s that show you exactly how much o@@ il cost@@ s, what's not avail@@ able, how food sup@@ ply is being aff@@ ect@@ ed,
how tran@@ sport@@ ation is being aff@@ ect@@ ed, if school@@ s are clo@@ se@@ d, if there's ri@@ ot@@ ing, and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were tru@@ e. And then we ask you to blo@@ g about it, to po@@ st vide@@ o@@ s, to po@@ st pho@@ to@@ s.
We pi@@ lo@@ ted this game with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 200@@ 7@@ , and we've trac@@ ked them for the three years s@@ inc@@ e. And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ form@@ ative experi@@ ence.
No@@ body want@@ s to change how they liv@@ e, just because it's good for the world, or because we're sup@@ posed to.
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them, "@@ We've run out of o@@ il@@ .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on.
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge your@@ self to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ ve@@ ,"
most of our play@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the h@@ ab@@ its that they learned in this gam@@ e.
So for the next world@@ -@@ sav@@ ing gam@@ e, we decided to ai@@ m high@@ er -- bigg@@ er problem than just pe@@ ak o@@ il@@ .
We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ st@@ it@@ ute for the F@@ ut@@ u@@ re. And the pre@@ mi@@ se was, a super@@ computer has c@@ alc@@ ul@@ ated that human@@ s have only 2@@ 3 years left on the plan@@ et.
This super@@ computer was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess S@@ y@@ stem@@ , of cour@@ se.
We asked people to come online -- almost like a J@@ er@@ ry B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movi@@ e.
You know J@@ er@@ ry B@@ r@@ uc@@ k@@ he@@ im@@ er movi@@ es, you form a dre@@ am team -- you've got the a@@ stron@@ aut@@ , the scientist@@ , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t, and they all have something to do to s@@ ave the world. But in our gam@@ e, instead of just having five people on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , we said, "@@ Every@@ bod@@ y's on the dre@@ am te@@ am@@ , and it's your job to inv@@ ent the future of ener@@ g@@ y, the future of fo@@ od, the future of heal@@ th, the future of se@@ cur@@ ity and the future of the social sa@@ f@@ et@@ y net@@ ."
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight wee@@ ks. They came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely cre@@ ative solut@@ ions that you can go on@@ lin@@ e, Google "@@ Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t@@ ," and se@@ e.
So, fin@@ ally, the last gam@@ e, we're la@@ un@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d. This is a game done with the World B@@ ank In@@ st@@ itut@@ e.
If you compl@@ ete the gam@@ e, you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the World B@@ ank In@@ st@@ it@@ ute as a So@@ ci@@ al In@@ nov@@ ator@@ , clas@@ s of 20@@ 10@@ .
Wor@@ king with univers@@ ities all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ har@@ an Africa, and we are invit@@ ing them to learn social innov@@ ation s@@ kill@@ s.
We've got a graph@@ ic nov@@ el, we've got level@@ ing up in s@@ kill@@ s like local insi@@ ght, knowled@@ ge net@@ work@@ ing, sustain@@ abilit@@ y, vi@@ sion and re@@ sour@@ ce@@ ful@@ nes@@ s.
I would like to invit@@ e all of you to pl@@ e@@ ase share this game with young people, any@@ where in the world, particul@@ arly in developing are@@ as, who might ben@@ ef@@ it from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social ent@@ er@@ pri@@ ses to s@@ ave the world.
So, I'm going to w@@ ra@@ p up now.
I want to ask a quest@@ ion.
What do you think happens nex@@ t@@ ?
We've got all these amazing gam@@ ers, we've got these gam@@ es that are kind of pi@@ lots of what we might do, but n@@ one of them have sav@@ ed the real world y@@ et.
Well I hope you will agre@@ e with me that gam@@ ers are a human re@@ source that we can use to do real@@ -@@ world work, that gam@@ es are a powerful pl@@ at@@ form for chang@@ e. We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s: bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivit@@ y, the ability to we@@ ave a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ric@@ , this feeling of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ ti@@ mis@@ m and the desi@@ re for epi@@ c mean@@ ing.
I really hope that we can come together to play gam@@ es that mat@@ ter, to sur@@ vive on this planet for another centur@@ y. That's my hop@@ e, that you will jo@@ in me in making and pla@@ ying gam@@ es like this.
When I look for@@ ward to the next deca@@ de, I know two things for su@@ re@@ : that we can make any future we can imag@@ ine, and we can play any gam@@ es we want@@ , so I sa@@ y:
Let the world@@ -@@ chang@@ ing gam@@ es begin@@ .
Thank you.
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effec@@ t, which might see@@ m like an od@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in, un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "S@@ o@@ me@@ thing fa@@ ke is believ@@ ed in enough by somebody that it be@@ comes something real@@ ." In other wor@@ ds, su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ ll@@ s have a meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble eff@@ ect in certain kinds of studi@@ es, the plac@@ e@@ bo effec@@ t, just because the person thin@@ ks
that what's happening to them is a ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical or some sort of a --
for pa@@ in manag@@ ement@@ , for example, if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble eff@@ ect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effec@@ t.
So@@ me@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ on@@ e's perce@@ ption of it.
In order for us to understand each other@@ , I want to start by show@@ ing you a ru@@ diment@@ ar@@ y, very simple mag@@ ic tr@@ ic@@ k.
And I'm going to show you how it work@@ s. This is a tr@@ ick that's been in every children@@ 's mag@@ ic book since at least the 19@@ 50@@ s.
I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b S@@ co@@ ut M@@ ag@@ ic in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s.
I'll do it for you, and then I'll ex@@ pla@@ in it.
And then I'll ex@@ pla@@ in why I expl@@ ain@@ ed it.
So, here's what happen@@ s.
The k@@ ni@@ f@@ e, which you can ex@@ amin@@ e; my hand@@ , which you could ex@@ am@@ ine.
I'm just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this.
I'll get my sle@@ eve bac@@ k.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve
I'm just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here.
That way you can see that at no time can anything trav@@ el, as long as I'm squ@@ e@@ e@@ z@@ ing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e.
And the objec@@ t of this is quite simpl@@ e.
I'm going to open my hand@@ , and hop@@ e@@ full@@ y, if all is well, my pure anim@@ al mag@@ net@@ is@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ f@@ e.
In fact it's hel@@ d so ti@@ ght@@ ly in place that I can sh@@ ake it, and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off@@ .
No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e,
no tr@@ ick@@ er@@ y. And you can ex@@ am@@ ine every@@ thing.
T@@ a-@@ da@@ !
So, this is a tr@@ ick that I often te@@ ach to young children
that are interested in mag@@ ic, because you can learn a great deal about de@@ ce@@ ption by stu@@ d@@ ying this very -- even though it's a very simple tr@@ ick me@@ th@@ od@@ olog@@ ic@@ ally.
Pro@@ b@@ ably many of you in the room know this tr@@ ic@@ k.
What happens is this. I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand@@ .
I say I'm going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ ri@@ st
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ ev@@ e, that is a li@@ e.
The reason I'm hol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ ri@@ st is because that's actually the se@@ cre@@ t of the illu@@ sion@@ .
In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you, this f@@ ing@@ er right here, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is, to a positi@@ on point@@ ing out like this. N@@ ice one.
So@@ me@@ one who didn't have a child@@ ho@@ od is out there.
So, it goes like this, from here, right.
And as I move around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ ft@@ s.
And we could talk about why this is de@@ ce@@ p@@ tiv@@ e, why you don't not@@ ice there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here, because the min@@ d, and the way it proc@@ es@@ ses inform@@ ation, it doesn't coun@@ t, one, tw@@ o, thre@@ e. It group@@ s them.
But that's not really what this is ab@@ out. Ri@@ ght@@ ? And then I open my hand up. O@@ b@@ vi@@ ously it's cl@@ ing@@ ing there, not by anim@@ al mag@@ net@@ is@@ m, but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y, my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there.
And then when I close my f@@ ing@@ er, same thing, as I move bac@@ k, this mo@@ tion kind of cover@@ s the moving back of my f@@ ing@@ er.
I take this hand a@@ way. You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out.
There is a tr@@ ick you can do for your friends and neighbor@@ s. Th@@ an@@ ks.
Now, what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effec@@ t@@ ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really b@@ le@@ w my mind wi@@ de op@@ en.
I'm not a doc@@ tor or a research@@ er, so this, to me, was an ast@@ oni@@ sh@@ ing thing.
It turns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ist@@ er a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a wh@@ ite pi@@ ll@@ , that's like as@@ pir@@ in shap@@ ed -- it's just a ro@@ und wh@@ ite pi@@ ll -- it has some certain meas@@ u@@ ra@@ ble effec@@ t.
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in, like you make a small@@ er pi@@ ll@@ , and colo@@ r it blu@@ e, and st@@ am@@ p a l@@ etter into it, it is actually meas@@ u@@ ra@@ bly more effec@@ tiv@@ e.
E@@ ven though ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical -- they're su@@ g@@ ar pi@@ ll@@ s.
But a wh@@ ite pi@@ ll is not as good as a bl@@ ue pi@@ ll@@ .
Wh@@ at@@ ? That really fli@@ pped me out.
T@@ ur@@ ns out thou@@ gh, that that's not even where it stop@@ s.
If you have cap@@ sul@@ es, they're more effec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ let@@ s in any form@@ .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ sul@@ e, that's y@@ ell@@ ow on one end and red on the other is better than a wh@@ ite cap@@ su@@ le.
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this.
One pi@@ ll tw@@ ice a day is not as good at three pi@@ ll@@ s -- I don't remember the stati@@ sti@@ c now. S@@ or@@ r@@ y.
But the point is ...
... these do@@ s@@ ages have something to do with it.
And the form has something to do with it.
And if you want the ul@@ tim@@ ate in plac@@ e@@ b@@ o, you've go to the need@@ le.
Ri@@ ght@@ ? A sy@@ r@@ ing@@ e with some in@@ er@@ t -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ er@@ t some@@ thing,
and you in@@ jec@@ t this into a pati@@ ent ...
Well this is such a powerful im@@ age in their min@@ d, it's so much stron@@ g@@ er than the wh@@ ite pi@@ ll@@ .
It's a really, this graph@@ , well I'll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ de@@ s.
The point is the wh@@ ite pi@@ ll is not as good as the bl@@ ue pi@@ ll is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le.
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ical qual@@ ity,
it's only your beli@@ e@@ f that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ g@@ er effec@@ t.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and ap@@ ply it to a mag@@ ic tr@@ ic@@ k.
And take something that is obvi@@ ously a fa@@ ke tr@@ ick and make it see@@ m re@@ al.
And we know from that study that when you want real@@ ity, you go to the need@@ le.
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in. It's very, very shar@@ p,
and I'm going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a tin@@ y b@@ it.
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h@@ . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an@@ 's speci@@ al@@ -@@ grow@@ n fl@@ es@@ h@@ .
That's my sk@@ in right there. This is not a Ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od speci@@ al effec@@ t.
I'm going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and run this need@@ le through to the other si@@ de.
If you're qu@@ easy -- if you f@@ ain@@ t easi@@ ly -- I was doing this for some friends in the ho@@ te@@ l room last ni@@ ght, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost pass@@ ed out.
So, I sugg@@ est if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact, you know what@@ , I'll do the first bad part behind it.
You@@ 'll get to see, you can look away too if you@@ 'd like to.
So, here is what happen@@ s, right here, the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the low@@ er part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y, man@@ . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you out@@ ?
OK@@ , and then just through my sk@@ in a tin@@ y b@@ it, and then out the other side like this.
Now, ess@@ enti@@ ally we're in the same positi@@ on we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tr@@ ic@@ k.
S@@ ort of@@ . But you can't coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you@@ ?
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two thre@@ e, four@@ , fi@@ ve. Y@@ es, well@@ ...
I know what people think when they see this.
They go, "Well, he's certa@@ inly not d@@ um@@ b enough to sta@@ b him@@ self through the sk@@ in to ent@@ er@@ ta@@ in us for a few minut@@ es.
So, let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k.
H@@ ow@@ 's that look out ther@@ e? P@@ re@@ tty go@@ od.
Ye@@ ah, I know. And the people in the back go, "O@@ K@@ , I didn't really see that@@ ."
People in the satell@@ ite room are starting to move in now.
Let me give you good close look at this.
That really is my s@@ kin@@ . That is not a Ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od speci@@ al effec@@ t.
That's my fl@@ es@@ h, and I can tw@@ i@@ st that aro@@ und.
I'm sor@@ r@@ y. If you're getting qu@@ eas@@ y, look a@@ way, don't look at the thing.
People in the back or people on video years from now wat@@ ching this will go, "@@ Well ye@@ ah, that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect there, but if it were real he would be --
see there's a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there, if it were real he would be b@@ le@@ ed@@ ing.
Well let me work up some bloo@@ d for you.
Y@@ es, there it is.
Nor@@ m@@ ally now, I would take the need@@ le out.
I would cle@@ an off my ar@@ m, and I would show you that there are no w@@ oun@@ ds.
But I think in this cont@@ ex@@ t and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something re@@ al, I'm just going to leave it there, and walk off the st@@ age.
I will be seeing you sever@@ al times over the next few da@@ ys. I hope you're looking for@@ ward to that. Thank you very much.
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I've lo@@ ved only tw@@ o.
That first one, it was more like a passion@@ ate aff@@ air@@ .
It was a beautiful fish@@ : f@@ lavor@@ ful, t@@ ex@@ tu@@ re@@ d, me@@ at@@ y, a b@@ est@@ se@@ ll@@ er on the men@@ u@@ .
What a fish@@ .
E@@ ven bet@@ ter, it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the sup@@ posed high@@ est stand@@ ar@@ ds of sustain@@ abilit@@ y.
So you could feel good about se@@ lling it.
I was in a relation@@ ship with this be@@ aut@@ y for sever@@ al month@@ s.
One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd spe@@ ak at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m@@ 's sustain@@ abilit@@ y.
"A@@ b@@ solut@@ el@@ y@@ ," I sai@@ d.
Here was a company trying to solve what's become this un@@ imag@@ in@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s:
How do we keep fish on our men@@ us@@ ?
For the past 50 years, we've been fish@@ ing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ c@@ ut forest@@ s.
It's hard to over@@ state the de@@ struc@@ tion.
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of large fish@@ , the ones we love -- the t@@ un@@ as, the h@@ ali@@ b@@ ut@@ s, the sal@@ mon@@ s, s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they've coll@@ ap@@ se@@ d.
There's almost nothing le@@ f@@ t.
So, for better or for wor@@ se, a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, fish far@@ m@@ ing, is going to be a part of our futu@@ re.
A lot of argu@@ ments against it@@ :
F@@ ish far@@ ms poll@@ ute -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they're in@@ effici@@ ent. T@@ ake t@@ un@@ a,
a maj@@ or dra@@ w@@ bac@@ k. It's got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o of 15 to one.
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ unds of w@@ il@@ d fish to get you one po@@ und of far@@ m t@@ un@@ a.
Not very sustain@@ able.
It doesn't ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther.
So here, fin@@ ally, was a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to suppor@@ t them.
The day before the ev@@ ent, I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ an@@ y.
Let's call him D@@ on.
"D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ i@@ ght, you guys are fam@@ ous for far@@ ming so far out to se@@ a, you don't poll@@ ut@@ e."
"@@ That's right@@ ," he sai@@ d. "@@ We're so far out, the wa@@ ste from our fish gets dist@@ ribut@@ ed, not con@@ cent@@ rat@@ ed@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ We're basically a world un@@ to our@@ selv@@ es.
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o? 2@@ .@@ 5 to on@@ e@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ B@@ est in the busin@@ ess@@ ."
2@@ .@@ 5 to one, great@@ .
"@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 what@@ ? What are you fe@@ ed@@ ing@@ ?"
"@@ Su@@ stain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ Gre@@ at@@ ," I sai@@ d. Go@@ t off the ph@@ one.
And that ni@@ ght, I was l@@ ying in b@@ ed, and I thou@@ ght@@ : What the h@@ ell is a sustain@@ able prote@@ in@@ ?
So the next day, just before the ev@@ ent, I called D@@ on.
I said, "D@@ on, what are some exampl@@ es of sustain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?"
He said he didn't know. He would ask aro@@ und.
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the comp@@ any@@ ; no one could give me a stra@@ ight answer
until fin@@ ally, I got on the phone with the head bi@@ ologi@@ st.
Let's call him D@@ on to@@ o.
"D@@ on@@ ," I said, "@@ what are some exampl@@ es of sustain@@ able prote@@ in@@ s@@ ?"
Well, he ment@@ ion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als, and then he said ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ et@@ s.
I said, "@@ Ch@@ ick@@ en p@@ ell@@ et@@ s@@ ?"
He said, "@@ Ye@@ ah, fe@@ a@@ ther@@ s, s@@ kin@@ , b@@ one me@@ al, sc@@ rap@@ s, dri@@ ed and proc@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed@@ ."
I said, "@@ What percent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is ch@@ ick@@ en@@ ?"
Th@@ in@@ king, you know, two percent@@ .
"Well, it's about 30 percent@@ ," he sai@@ d.
I said, "D@@ on, what's sustain@@ able about fe@@ ed@@ ing ch@@ ick@@ en to fish@@ ?"
There was a long pa@@ use on the lin@@ e, and he said, "@@ There's just too much ch@@ ick@@ en in the world@@ ."
I f@@ ell out of love with this fish@@ .
No, not because I'm some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous, go@@ od@@ y-@@ two sho@@ es fo@@ o@@ di@@ e.
I actually am@@ .
No, I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish bec@@ a@@ use, I s@@ we@@ ar to Go@@ d, after that convers@@ ation, the fish ta@@ st@@ ed like ch@@ ick@@ en.
This second fish@@ , it's a different kind of love story.
It's the ro@@ man@@ tic kin@@ d, the kind where the more you get to know your fish@@ , you love the fish@@ .
I first ate it at a rest@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in.
A jour@@ n@@ ali@@ st fri@@ end had been talking about this fish for a long time.
She kind of set us up.
It came to the t@@ able a bri@@ ght, almost sh@@ im@@ mer@@ ing, wh@@ ite col@@ or.
The che@@ f had over@@ co@@ o@@ ked it.
Li@@ ke tw@@ ice over@@ .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly, it was still del@@ ici@@ ous.
W@@ ho can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it's been over@@ co@@ o@@ k@@ ed@@ ?
I can@@ '@@ t, but this guy can@@ .
Let's call him Mi@@ gu@@ el --
actually his name is Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ .
And no, he didn't co@@ ok the fish@@ , and he's not a ch@@ ef@@ ,
at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a bi@@ ologi@@ st at V@@ et@@ a La P@@ al@@ ma. It's a fish far@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ ester@@ n cor@@ ner of S@@ pa@@ in. It's at the ti@@ p of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver@@ .
Un@@ til the 198@@ 0@@ s, the far@@ m was in the hand@@ s of the Ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ an@@ s.
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le on what was ess@@ enti@@ ally w@@ et@@ land@@ s.
They did it by dra@@ ining the land@@ . They built this in@@ tr@@ ic@@ ate seri@@ es of can@@ als, and they p@@ ush@@ ed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver@@ .
Well, they couldn't make it work, not econom@@ ic@@ ally.
And e@@ colo@@ g@@ ic@@ ally, it was a disa@@ st@@ er.
It kill@@ ed like 90 percent of the bir@@ ds, wh@@ ich@@ , for this plac@@ e, is a lot of bir@@ ds.
And so in 198@@ 2, a S@@ pan@@ ish company with an environ@@ mental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land@@ .
What did they do?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of wat@@ er.
They liter@@ ally fli@@ pped the s@@ wit@@ ch.
In@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ ush@@ ing water out, they used the chan@@ ne@@ l@@ s to pul@@ l water back in.
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als.
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re fish far@@ m -- bas@@ s, mu@@ ll@@ et, sh@@ rim@@ p, e@@ el -- and in the proc@@ ess, Mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical de@@ struc@@ tion.
The far@@ m@@ 's incredi@@ ble.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
You stare out at a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that is a million mi@@ les a@@ way, and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k, ric@@ h mar@@ sh@@ land@@ .
I was there not long ago with Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ .
He's an amazing gu@@ y, like three parts Char@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e.
Oka@@ y? There we are s@@ lo@@ gg@@ ing through the w@@ et@@ land@@ s, and I'm p@@ ant@@ ing and s@@ we@@ at@@ ing, got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es, and Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ 's cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a biolog@@ y l@@ ec@@ tu@@ re.
H@@ ere, he's point@@ ing out a rare B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ oul@@ der@@ ed K@@ it@@ e.
Now, he's ment@@ ion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al needs of phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on. And here, here he se@@ es a group@@ ing patter@@ n that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ anz@@ ani@@ an Gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e.
It turns out, Mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his care@@ er in the Mi@@ k@@ u@@ mi N@@ ational Par@@ k in Africa.
I asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish@@ .
He said, "@@ Fi@@ sh@@ ? I didn't know anything about fish@@ .
I'm an exper@@ t in relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s."
And then he's off@@ , la@@ un@@ ching into more talk about rare bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and str@@ ange a@@ qu@@ atic plant@@ s.
And don't get me wron@@ g, that was really f@@ ascin@@ at@@ ing, you know, the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ u@@ gg@@ ed, kind of thing.
It's great@@ , but I was in lo@@ ve.
And my head was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ co@@ o@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish I had the night befor@@ e.
So I inter@@ r@@ up@@ ted him@@ . I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, what makes your fish ta@@ ste so go@@ od@@ ?"
He point@@ ed at the al@@ ga@@ e.
"I know, du@@ de, the al@@ ga@@ e, the phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s: It's amaz@@ ing.
But what are your fish e@@ at@@ ing@@ ?
What's the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion r@@ ati@@ o@@ ?"
Well, he goes on to tell me it's such a ric@@ h system that the fish are e@@ ating what they@@ 'd be e@@ ating in the w@@ il@@ d.
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ as@@ s, the phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on, the z@@ o@@ opl@@ an@@ k@@ t@@ on, it's what fe@@ ed@@ s the fish@@ .
The system is so health@@ y, it's tot@@ ally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ w@@ ing.
There is no fe@@ ed.
E@@ ver heard of a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ al@@ s?
L@@ at@@ er that day, I was driv@@ ing around this pro@@ per@@ ty with Mi@@ gu@@ el, and I asked him@@ , I said, "@@ For a place that seems so natur@@ al, un@@ like like any far@@ m I'd ever been at, how do you meas@@ ure success@@ ?"
At that moment@@ , it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set chang@@ e.
And we ro@@ un@@ ded the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght@@ : thousands and thousands of p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, a liter@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could se@@ e.
"@@ That's success@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ Lo@@ ok at their bell@@ i@@ es, p@@ in@@ k.
They're fe@@ ast@@ ing@@ ."
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing@@ ? I was tot@@ ally conf@@ us@@ ed.
I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, ar@@ en't they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish@@ ?"
"@@ Y@@ es@@ ," he sai@@ d.
"@@ We lo@@ se 20 percent of our fish and fish e@@ gg@@ s to bir@@ ds.
Well, last year, this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bir@@ ds on it, more than 2@@ 50 different speci@@ es.
It's be@@ com@@ e, today, the larg@@ est and one of the most important priv@@ ate bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ari@@ es in all of Euro@@ pe@@ ."
I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, isn't a th@@ riv@@ ing bir@@ d population like the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m@@ ?"
He sho@@ ok his head@@ , no.
He said, "@@ We far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely, not inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y.
This is an e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical net@@ work.
The fl@@ am@@ ing@@ os e@@ at the sh@@ rim@@ p.
The sh@@ rim@@ p e@@ at the phy@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ t@@ on.
So the p@@ in@@ k@@ er the bell@@ y, the better the system@@ ."
Oka@@ y, so let's re@@ view@@ : a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ als, and a far@@ m that meas@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
A fish far@@ m, but also a bir@@ d s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ar@@ y.
O@@ h, and by the way, those fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, they sh@@ ouldn't even be there in the first plac@@ e.
They bro@@ od in a tow@@ n 1@@ 50 mi@@ les a@@ way, where the so@@ il condit@@ ions are better for building n@@ est@@ s.
E@@ very mor@@ n@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les into the far@@ m. And every ev@@ en@@ ing, they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les bac@@ k.
They do that because they're able to foll@@ ow the bro@@ ken wh@@ ite line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2@@ .
No ki@@ dd@@ ing.
I was imag@@ ining a "@@ Mar@@ ch of the Pen@@ gu@@ in@@ s@@ " thing, so I looked at Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ .
I said, "@@ Mi@@ gu@@ el, do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les to the far@@ m, and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 mi@@ les back at ni@@ ght@@ ?
Do they do that for the children@@ ?"
He looked at me like I had just qu@@ ot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ney H@@ ou@@ st@@ on son@@ g.
He said, "@@ No@@ ; they do it because the fo@@ od@@ 's bet@@ ter@@ ."
I didn't ment@@ ion the sk@@ in of my be@@ lo@@ ved fish@@ , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don't like fish s@@ kin@@ ;
I don't like it se@@ ar@@ ed, I don't like it cri@@ sp@@ y.
It's that ac@@ ri@@ d, tar@@ -@@ like f@@ lavor@@ .
I almost never co@@ ok with it.
Y@@ et, when I ta@@ st@@ ed it at that rest@@ a@@ ur@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in, it ta@@ st@@ ed not at all like fish s@@ kin@@ .
It ta@@ st@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and cle@@ an, like you were taking a b@@ ite of the oce@@ an.
I ment@@ ion@@ ed that to Mi@@ gu@@ el, and he no@@ d@@ de@@ d.
He said, "The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a spon@@ g@@ e.
It's the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se before anything ent@@ ers the bod@@ y.
It evol@@ ved to so@@ ak up imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, "@@ But our water has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ."
OK@@ . A far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its fish@@ ,
a far@@ m that meas@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the succ@@ ess of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s.
And then I realized when he says, "@@ A far@@ m that has no imp@@ ur@@ iti@@ es@@ ," he made a big underst@@ at@@ ement@@ , because the water that flow@@ s through that far@@ m comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver@@ . It's a riv@@ er that carri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s ten@@ d to car@@ ry these da@@ y@@ s: chem@@ ical cont@@ amin@@ ant@@ s, p@@ est@@ ici@@ de run@@ off@@ .
And when it works its way through the system and le@@ av@@ es, the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it ent@@ er@@ ed.
The system is so health@@ y, it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the wat@@ er.
So, not just a far@@ m that doesn't fe@@ ed its anim@@ als, not just a far@@ m that meas@@ u@@ res its succ@@ ess by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ or@@ s, but a far@@ m that's liter@@ ally a water pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those fish@@ , but for you and me as well.
Because when that water le@@ av@@ es, it d@@ um@@ ps out into the At@@ l@@ ant@@ ic.
A dro@@ p in the oce@@ an, I know, but I'll take it, and so should you, because this love stor@@ y, h@@ ow@@ ever ro@@ man@@ t@@ ic, is also in@@ struc@@ tiv@@ e.
You might say it's a re@@ ci@@ pe for the future of good fo@@ od, whether we're talking about bas@@ s or be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le.
What we need now is a radic@@ ally new conce@@ ption of ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re, one in which the food actually ta@@ st@@ es go@@ od.
But for a lot people, that's a bit too radic@@ al.
We're not real@@ ist@@ s, us fo@@ o@@ di@@ es@@ ;
we're lo@@ ver@@ s.
We love far@@ mer@@ s' market@@ s,
we love small family far@@ m@@ s,
we talk about local fo@@ od,
we e@@ at org@@ an@@ ic.
And when you sugg@@ est these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good fo@@ od, some@@ one, some@@ where stand@@ s up and says, "@@ H@@ ey gu@@ y, I love p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o@@ s, but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world@@ ?"
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world@@ ?
Can I be hon@@ est@@ ?
I don't love that quest@@ ion.
No, not because we already produce enough cal@@ ori@@ es to more than fe@@ ed the world.
One billion people will go hun@@ gr@@ y today.
One billion -- that's more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss ine@@ qual@@ ities in dist@@ ribut@@ ion, not ton@@ n@@ age.
Now, I don't love this question because it's determin@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years.
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es, p@@ est@@ ic@@ ide@@ s to mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tu@@ re@@ s, chem@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il@@ , ch@@ ick@@ en to fish@@ , and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ If we're fe@@ ed@@ ing more people more che@@ ap@@ ly, how terri@@ ble could that be@@ ?"
That's been the motiv@@ ation,
it's been the ju@@ sti@@ fic@@ ation@@ :
it's been the business pl@@ an of American ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re.
We should call it what it is@@ : a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation, a business that's quick@@ ly ero@@ ding e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical capit@@ al that makes that very produc@@ tion possi@@ ble.
That's not a busin@@ ess, and it isn't ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re.
Our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today, not because of di@@ mini@@ sh@@ ing sup@@ pl@@ y, but because of di@@ mini@@ sh@@ ing resourc@@ es. Not by the lat@@ est comb@@ ine and tr@@ act@@ or invent@@ ion, but by fer@@ ti@@ le land@@ ; not by p@@ um@@ p@@ s, but by fre@@ sh wat@@ er@@ ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ w@@ s, but by forest@@ s@@ ; and not by fish@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and net@@ s, but by fish in the se@@ a.
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world@@ ?
Let's start by as@@ k@@ ing@@ : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ selv@@ es?
Or bet@@ ter@@ : How can we create condit@@ ions that en@@ able every community to fe@@ ed it@@ self@@ ?
To do that, don't look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the futu@@ re.
It's really ol@@ d, and it's ti@@ re@@ d.
It's high on capit@@ al, chem@@ i@@ str@@ y and mach@@ in@@ es, and it's never produc@@ ed anything really good to e@@ at.
In@@ ste@@ ad, let's look to the e@@ colo@@ g@@ ical model@@ .
That's the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ job experi@@ ence.
Lo@@ ok to Mi@@ gu@@ el, far@@ mer@@ s like Mi@@ gu@@ el@@ . F@@ ar@@ ms that ar@@ en't worl@@ ds un@@ to them@@ selv@@ es@@ ; far@@ ms that rest@@ ore instead of de@@ pl@@ et@@ e; far@@ ms that far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vel@@ y@@ ; far@@ mer@@ s that are not just produc@@ ers, but exper@@ ts in relation@@ shi@@ p@@ s. Because they're the ones that are exper@@ ts in f@@ lavor@@ , to@@ o.
And if I'm going to be really hon@@ est@@ , they're a better che@@ f than I'll ever b@@ e.
You know, I'm o@@ ka@@ y with that, because if that's the future of good fo@@ od, it's going to be del@@ ici@@ ous.
Thank you.
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science fic@@ tion.
In high school@@ , I took a bu@@ s to school an h@@ our each way every day.
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a boo@@ k, science fic@@ tion boo@@ k, which took my mind to other worl@@ ds, and s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed, in a nar@@ r@@ ative form@@ , this in@@ s@@ ati@@ able sense of curi@@ os@@ ity that I h@@ ad.
And you know, that curi@@ os@@ ity also mani@@ fest@@ ed it@@ self in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn't in school I was out in the wo@@ od@@ s, hi@@ king and taking "@@ s@@ ampl@@ es@@ " -- fro@@ gs and s@@ n@@ ak@@ es and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it bac@@ k, looking at it under the micro@@ sco@@ p@@ e.
You know, I was a real science ge@@ e@@ k.
But it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the lim@@ its of possibilit@@ y.
And my love of science fic@@ tion actually seem@@ ed mi@@ r@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me, because what was happen@@ ing, this was in the l@@ ate '@@ 6@@ 0@@ s, we were going to the mo@@ on, we were ex@@ plor@@ ing the de@@ ep oce@@ an@@ s. J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u was coming into our living room@@ s with his amazing speci@@ als that show@@ ed us animals and places and a won@@ dro@@ us world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ously imag@@ in@@ ed.
So, that seem@@ ed to re@@ son@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it.
And I was an artist@@ .
I could dra@@ w@@ . I could paint@@ .
And I found that because there w@@ er@@ en't video gam@@ es and this sat@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G movi@@ es and all of this imag@@ er@@ y in the media land@@ sc@@ ap@@ e, I had to create these imag@@ es in my head@@ .
You know, we all di@@ d, as kids having to read a boo@@ k, and through the auth@@ or@@ 's de@@ script@@ ion, put something on the movi@@ e scre@@ en in our head@@ s.
And so, my respon@@ se to this was to paint@@ , to dra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ atu@@ re@@ s, ali@@ en worl@@ ds, robo@@ ts, spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p@@ s, all that stuff@@ .
I was end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h clas@@ s do@@ od@@ ling behind the t@@ ext@@ boo@@ k.
That was -- the creati@@ vit@@ y had to find its out@@ let some@@ h@@ ow@@ .
And an interesting thing happen@@ ed@@ : The J@@ acqu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ a@@ u shows actually got me very excit@@ ed about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Ear@@ th.
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p so@@ med@@ ay --
that seem@@ ed pretty dar@@ n un@@ lik@@ el@@ y.
But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Ear@@ th, that was as ric@@ h and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that I had imag@@ ined from read@@ ing these boo@@ ks.
So, I decided I was going to become a scu@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 1@@ 5@@ .
And the only problem with that was that I liv@@ ed in a little vill@@ age in Can@@ ad@@ a, 6@@ 00 mi@@ les from the ne@@ ar@@ est oce@@ an.
But I didn't let that da@@ un@@ t me.
I p@@ ester@@ ed my father until he fin@@ ally found a scu@@ ba clas@@ s in B@@ uff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k, right across the bor@@ der from where we liv@@ e.
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of w@@ int@@ er in B@@ uff@@ al@@ o, New Yor@@ k.
And I didn't see the oce@@ an, a real oce@@ an, for another two years, until we mov@@ ed to Californi@@ a.
S@@ in@@ ce then, in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years, I've spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ wat@@ er, and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bl@@ es.
And I've learned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an environ@@ ment, and even the sh@@ allow oce@@ an@@ s, are so ric@@ h with amazing life that really is bey@@ ond our imag@@ in@@ ation.
N@@ atu@@ re@@ 's imag@@ in@@ ation is so bo@@ und@@ less compar@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human imag@@ in@@ ation.
I sti@@ ll@@ , to this day, st@@ and in absolut@@ e a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ v@@ es.
And my love aff@@ air with the oce@@ an is on@@ go@@ ing, and just as str@@ ong as it ever was@@ .
But when I ch@@ ose a care@@ er as an adul@@ t, it was fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ing.
And that seem@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ g@@ es to create imag@@ es.
And I was, as a ki@@ d, con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly dra@@ w@@ ing com@@ ic boo@@ ks, and so on.
So, fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictu@@ res and stories
together, and that made sen@@ se.
And of course the stories that I ch@@ ose to tell were science fic@@ tion stori@@ es@@ : "@@ Ter@@ min@@ ator@@ ," "A@@ li@@ en@@ s@@ " and "The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss@@ ."
And with "The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss@@ ," I was put@@ ting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ing.
So, you know, mer@@ g@@ ing the two passion@@ s.
So@@ me@@ thing interesting came out of "The A@@ b@@ y@@ ss@@ ," which was that to solve a speci@@ fic nar@@ r@@ ative problem on that fil@@ m, which was to create this kind of li@@ qui@@ d water cre@@ atu@@ re, we actually embr@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anim@@ ation, C@@ G@@ .
And this resul@@ ted in the first so@@ ft@@ -@@ sur@@ face char@@ ac@@ ter, C@@ G anim@@ ation that was ever in a movi@@ e.
And even though the film didn't make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke ev@@ en, I should say -- I wit@@ ness@@ ed something amaz@@ ing, which is that the audi@@ ence, the global audi@@ ence, was mes@@ mer@@ i@@ zed by this appar@@ ent mag@@ ic.
You know, it's Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ k@@ e's la@@ w that any suff@@ ici@@ ently adv@@ anc@@ ed technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ i@@ sh@@ able from mag@@ ic.
They were seeing something mag@@ ic@@ al.
And so that got me very excit@@ ed.
And I thought, "@@ W@@ ow, this is something that needs to be embr@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ atic art@@ ."
So, with "@@ Ter@@ min@@ at@@ or 2@@ ," which was my next fil@@ m, we took that much far@@ ther.
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M@@ , we created the li@@ qui@@ d met@@ al du@@ de in that fil@@ m. The succ@@ ess hun@@ g in the bal@@ ance on whether that eff@@ ect would work.
And it di@@ d, and we created mag@@ ic again,
and we had the same resul@@ t with an audi@@ ence --
al@@ though we did make a little more money on that one.
So, dra@@ w@@ ing a line through those two do@@ ts of experience came to, "@@ This is going to be a whole new world@@ ," this was a whole new world of creati@@ vit@@ y for film artist@@ s.
So, I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on, who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ ature design@@ er at that time, and it was called D@@ ig@@ it@@ al Do@@ ma@@ in.
And the conce@@ pt of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the anal@@ o@@ g proc@@ es@@ ses of op@@ t@@ ical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on, and we would go right to digit@@ al produc@@ tion.
And we actually did that and it gave us a compet@@ itive adv@@ ant@@ age for a wh@@ il@@ e.
But we found ourselves l@@ agg@@ ing in the mi@@ d '@@ 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ ature and char@@ act@@ er design stuff that we had actually fo@@ un@@ ded the company to do.
So, I wro@@ te this piece called "@@ Av@@ at@@ ar@@ ," which was me@@ ant to absolutely p@@ ush the en@@ velo@@ pe of visu@@ al effec@@ ts, of C@@ G effec@@ ts, bey@@ on@@ d, with real@@ ist@@ ic human emo@@ tive char@@ ac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G@@ , and the main char@@ ac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G@@ , and the world would be in C@@ G@@ .
And the en@@ velo@@ pe p@@ ush@@ ed bac@@ k,
and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we w@@ er@@ en't going to be able to do this for a wh@@ il@@ e.
So, I sh@@ el@@ ved it, and I made this other movi@@ e about a big ship that sin@@ ks.
You know, I went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as "@@ '@@ Ro@@ me@@ o and Ju@@ li@@ et@@ ' on a shi@@ p@@ :
"@@ It's going to be this epi@@ c ro@@ man@@ ce, passion@@ ate fil@@ m@@ ."
S@@ ec@@ ret@@ ly, what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ."
And that's why I made the movi@@ e.
And that's the tru@@ th. Now, the studio didn't know that.
But I conv@@ inc@@ ed them. I said, "@@ We're going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k. We're going to film it for re@@ al.
We@@ 'll be using it in the open@@ ing of the fil@@ m.
It will be really important@@ . It will be a great market@@ ing ho@@ o@@ k@@ ."
And I talked them into fun@@ ding an exp@@ ed@@ it@@ ion.
S@@ oun@@ ds cra@@ z@@ y. But this goes back to that them@@ e about your imag@@ in@@ ation creating a real@@ ity.
Because we actually created a real@@ ity where six months later, I find myself in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half mi@@ les down in the n@@ orth At@@ l@@ ant@@ ic, looking at the real T@@ it@@ ani@@ c through a view port@@ . Not a movi@@ e, not H@@ D -- for re@@ al.
Now, that b@@ le@@ w my min@@ d.
And it took a lot of prepar@@ ation, we had to build cam@@ er@@ as and li@@ ghts and all kinds of things.
B@@ ut, it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve, these de@@ ep di@@ v@@ es, was like a space missi@@ on.
You know, where it was high@@ ly tech@@ n@@ ic@@ al, and it re@@ qui@@ red enor@@ m@@ ous pl@@ ann@@ ing.
You get in this cap@@ sul@@ e, you go down to this dar@@ k ho@@ sti@@ le environ@@ ment where there is no hope of re@@ sc@@ ue if you can't get back by your@@ self.
And I thought like, "@@ W@@ ow@@ . I'm like, living in a science fic@@ tion movi@@ e.
This is really co@@ ol@@ ."
And so, I really got bit@@ t@@ en by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ oce@@ an ex@@ plor@@ ation.
O@@ f course, the curi@@ os@@ ity, the science compon@@ ent of it --
it was every@@ thing. It was ad@@ vent@@ u@@ re,
it was curi@@ os@@ ity, it was imag@@ in@@ ation.
And it was an experience that Ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od couldn't give me.
B@@ ec@@ a@@ use, you know, I could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visu@@ al eff@@ ect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that win@@ dow@@ .
As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent exp@@ ed@@ it@@ ions, I was seeing cre@@ atu@@ res at hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ m@@ al vent@@ s and sometimes things that I had never seen befor@@ e, sometimes things that no one had seen befor@@ e, that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them.
So, I was completely sm@@ itt@@ en by this, and had to do more.
And so, I actually made a kind of curi@@ ous decision@@ .
A@@ fter the succ@@ ess of "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ ," I said, "O@@ K@@ , I'm going to par@@ k my day job as a Ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wo@@ od movi@@ e mak@@ er, and I'm going to go be a full@@ -@@ time ex@@ plor@@ er for a wh@@ il@@ e."
And so, we started pl@@ ann@@ ing these exp@@ ed@@ it@@ ions.
And we wo@@ und up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k, and ex@@ plor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ l@@ es.
We went back to the T@@ it@@ ani@@ c w@@ rec@@ k.
We took little bo@@ ts that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ t@@ ic.
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ ve@@ y of that shi@@ p, which had never been don@@ e.
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k. They didn't have the means to do it, so we created technology to do it.
So, you know, here I am now, on the dec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic, sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble, and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this, where I knew that the b@@ and had play@@ ed.
And I'm fl@@ ying a little robo@@ tic ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ do@@ r of the shi@@ p.
When I say, "@@ I'm oper@@ ating it@@ ," but my mind is in the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le.
I felt like I was physic@@ ally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic.
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience I've ever h@@ ad, because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ ghts of the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it, because I had wal@@ ked the set for months when we were making the movi@@ e.
And the set was based as an ex@@ act re@@ pl@@ ica on the blu@@ e@@ pr@@ int@@ s of the shi@@ p.
So, it was this absolutely re@@ mark@@ able experi@@ ence.
And it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ar@@ s, then your consci@@ ous@@ ness is in@@ jec@@ ted into the ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le, into this other form of exist@@ ence.
It was really, really quite pro@@ fo@@ und.
And it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some deca@@ des out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bo@@ di@@ es for ex@@ plor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of post@@ -@@ human futu@@ res that I can imag@@ ine, as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an.
So, having done these exp@@ ed@@ it@@ ions, and really beginning to ap@@ preci@@ ate what was down there, such as at the de@@ ep oce@@ an vent@@ s where we had these amaz@@ ing, amazing animals --
they're basically ali@@ ens right here on Ear@@ th.
They live in an environ@@ ment of chem@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ thes@@ is.
They don't sur@@ vive on sun@@ light@@ -@@ based system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 00@@ -@@ degre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ gra@@ de water pl@@ um@@ es.
You think they can't possi@@ bly exist@@ .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again, it's the science fic@@ tion influ@@ ence, as a ki@@ d.
And I wo@@ und up getting invol@@ ved with the space commun@@ ity, really invol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ S@@ A, sitting on the N@@ A@@ S@@ A ad@@ vi@@ sor@@ y bo@@ ar@@ d, pl@@ ann@@ ing actu@@ al space missi@@ on@@ s, going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a, going through the pre@@ -@@ cos@@ mon@@ a@@ ut bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical proto@@ col@@ s, and all these sort@@ s of things, to actually go and f@@ ly to the intern@@ ational space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camera system@@ s.
And this was f@@ ascin@@ at@@ ing.
But what I wo@@ und up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space scientist@@ s with us into the de@@ ep@@ .
And taking them down so that they had access -- ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ ologi@@ st@@ s, plan@@ et@@ ary scientist@@ s, people who were interested in these ex@@ tre@@ me environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the vent@@ s, and lett@@ ing them see, and take s@@ ampl@@ es and test in@@ stru@@ ment@@ s, and so on.
So, here we were making docu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ m@@ s, but actually doing sci@@ ence, and actually doing space sci@@ ence.
I'd completely clo@@ sed the loo@@ p between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an, you know, as a ki@@ d, and doing this stuff for re@@ al.
And you know, along the way in this jour@@ ney of discover@@ y, I learned a lo@@ t.
I learned a lot about sci@@ ence. But I also learned a lot about lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p.
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lead@@ er, leader of@@ , cap@@ ta@@ in of the shi@@ p, and all that sort of thing.
I didn't really learn about lead@@ er@@ ship until I did these exp@@ ed@@ it@@ ions.
Because I had to, at a certain point@@ , say, "@@ What am I doing out her@@ e?
Why am I doing this@@ ? What do I get out of it@@ ?"
We don't make money at these dam@@ n show@@ s.
We bar@@ ely bre@@ ak ev@@ en. There is no f@@ ame in it.
People sort of think I went away between "@@ T@@ it@@ an@@ ic@@ " and "@@ Av@@ at@@ ar@@ " and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ail@@ s some@@ plac@@ e, sitting at the be@@ ach@@ .
M@@ ade all these fil@@ m@@ s, made all these docu@@ ment@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very limit@@ ed audi@@ ence.
No fam@@ e, no g@@ lor@@ y, no mone@@ y. What are you do@@ ing@@ ?
You're doing it for the t@@ ask it@@ self, for the chall@@ en@@ ge -- and the oce@@ an is the most challeng@@ ing environ@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of discover@@ y, and for that str@@ ange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ght@@ ly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am@@ .
Because we would do these things with 1@@ 0, 12 people, working for years at a time,
sometimes at se@@ a for tw@@ o, three months at a time.
And in that b@@ on@@ d, you realize that the most important thing is the re@@ sp@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a t@@ ask that you can't ex@@ pla@@ in to someone el@@ se.
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say, "@@ We had to do this, and the fi@@ ber op@@ t@@ ic, and the att@@ entu@@ ation, and the this and the that, all the technology of it, and the difficul@@ t@@ y, the human@@ -@@ performan@@ ce asp@@ ec@@ ts of working at se@@ a@@ ," you can't ex@@ pla@@ in it to people. It's that thing that maybe co@@ ps hav@@ e, or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never ex@@ pla@@ in it.
Cre@@ ates a b@@ on@@ d, cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of re@@ spec@@ t.
So, when I came back to make my next movi@@ e, which was "@@ Av@@ at@@ ar@@ ," I tried to ap@@ ply that same princi@@ ple of lead@@ er@@ shi@@ p, which is that you re@@ sp@@ ect your te@@ am@@ , and you ear@@ n their re@@ sp@@ ect in re@@ tur@@ n.
And it really changed the dy@@ nam@@ ic.
So, here I was again with a small te@@ am@@ , in un@@ ch@@ art@@ ed ter@@ rit@@ or@@ y, doing "@@ Av@@ at@@ ar@@ ," coming up with new technology that didn't ex@@ i@@ st befor@@ e.
T@@ rem@@ end@@ ously excit@@ ing.
T@@ rem@@ end@@ ously challeng@@ ing.
And we became a fam@@ il@@ y, over a four@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year perio@@ d.
And it completely changed how I do movi@@ es.
So, people have com@@ ment@@ ed on h@@ ow, "Well, you know, you brought back the oce@@ an organis@@ ms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a."
To me, it was more of a fundament@@ al way of doing busin@@ ess, the process it@@ self, that changed as a resul@@ t of that.
So, what can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ esi@@ ze out of all this@@ ?
You know, what are the les@@ son@@ s lear@@ ne@@ d@@ ?
Well, I think number one is curi@@ os@@ ity.
It's the most powerful thing you ow@@ n.
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually mani@@ f@@ est a real@@ ity.
And the re@@ sp@@ ect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world.
I have young fil@@ m@@ mak@@ ers come up to me and say, "@@ Gi@@ ve me some adv@@ ice for doing this@@ ."
And I say, "D@@ on@@ 't put limit@@ ations on your@@ self.
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don't do it to your@@ self, don't be@@ t against your@@ self,
and take ris@@ k@@ s."
N@@ A@@ S@@ A has this ph@@ r@@ ase that they lik@@ e: "@@ F@@ ail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion@@ ."
But fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in ex@@ plor@@ ation, because it's a lea@@ p of f@@ ai@@ th.
And no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that re@@ qui@@ red innov@@ ation was done without ris@@ k.
You have to be wi@@ lling to take those ris@@ ks.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with@@ , is that in whatever you're do@@ ing, fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion, but fe@@ ar is no@@ t. Thank you.
If I can leave you with one big idea today, it's that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is great@@ er that the su@@ m of the part@@ s, and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad, what I'd like you to think about is how we can use information so that patter@@ ns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ end@@ s that would other@@ wi@@ se be in@@ visi@@ ble.
So what we're looking at right here is a ty@@ pic@@ al mort@@ al@@ ity char@@ t organi@@ zed by age.
This to@@ ol that I'm using here is a little experiment@@ .
It's called Pi@@ vo@@ t, and with Pi@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can cho@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of de@@ ath@@ s -- say, acci@@ dent@@ s.
An@@ d, right a@@ way, I see there's a different patter@@ n that emerg@@ es.
This is bec@@ a@@ use, in the mi@@ d-@@ area here, people are at their most ac@@ tiv@@ e, and over here they're at their most fra@@ il@@ .
We can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of de@@ a@@ th, seeing that cir@@ cul@@ ator@@ y diseas@@ es and cancer are the us@@ ual s@@ us@@ p@@ ec@@ ts, but not for every@@ one.
If we go a@@ head and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dent@@ s are actually the great@@ est cause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed ab@@ out.
And if you dri@@ ll into that, it's espe@@ ci@@ ally the case for men@@ .
So you get the idea that view@@ ing inform@@ ation, view@@ ing data in this way, is a lot like s@@ w@@ im@@ ming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graph@@ ic.
And if we can do this for ra@@ w dat@@ a, why not do it for cont@@ ent as well@@ ?
So what we have right here is the cover of every single S@@ port@@ s I@@ ll@@ u@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed.
It's all her@@ e; it's all on the web@@ .
You can go back to your room@@ s and try this after my tal@@ k.
W@@ ith Pi@@ vo@@ t, you can dri@@ ll into a deca@@ de.
You can dri@@ ll into a particular year.
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a speci@@ fic issu@@ e.
So I'm looking at this@@ ; I see the ath@@ let@@ es that have appear@@ ed in this issu@@ e, the sport@@ s.
I'm a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an, so I'll go a@@ head and I'll cl@@ ick on that, which re@@ ve@@ als, for me, all the issu@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ stron@@ g@@ 's been a part of@@ .
Now, if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at thes@@ e, I might think, "Well, what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing@@ ?"
So I can step bac@@ k, and exp@@ and on that.
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ Mon@@ d now.
And so you get the idea that when you nav@@ ig@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ row@@ er, bro@@ ad@@ er, bac@@ king in, bac@@ king out -- you're not se@@ arch@@ ing, you're not bro@@ w@@ s@@ ing.
You're doing something that's actually a little bit differ@@ ent.
It's in betwe@@ en, and we think it chang@@ es the way information can be us@@ ed.
So I want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that's a little bit cra@@ z@@ y.
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia p@@ age and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y. So the sum@@ mar@@ y con@@ sist@@ s of just a little sy@@ no@@ psi@@ s and an i@@ con to indic@@ ate the to@@ pic@@ al area that it comes fro@@ m.
I'm only show@@ ing the top 500 most popul@@ ar Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia pag@@ es right here.
But even in this limit@@ ed view@@ , we can do a lot of things.
Ri@@ ght a@@ way, we get a sense of what are the to@@ pic@@ al do@@ ma@@ ins that are most popul@@ ar on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a.
I'm going to go a@@ head and sel@@ ect govern@@ ment.
Now, having sel@@ ected govern@@ ment, I can now see that the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia cat@@ eg@@ ori@@ es that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine People of the Y@@ ear@@ .
So this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not cont@@ ain@@ ed within any one Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ dia pag@@ e.
It's only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them.
Lo@@ o@@ king at one of these particular sum@@ m@@ ari@@ es, I can then dri@@ ll into the conce@@ pt of T@@ im@@ e mag@@ az@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear@@ ,
br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them.
So looking at these people, I can see that the maj@@ or@@ ity come from govern@@ ment@@ ; some have come from natural sci@@ enc@@ es@@ ; so@@ me, fe@@ w@@ er sti@@ ll@@ , have come from business --
there's my bo@@ ss --
and one has come from mus@@ ic.
And interest@@ ing@@ ly enou@@ gh, B@@ ono is also a TED Pri@@ ze win@@ n@@ er.
So we can go, j@@ um@@ p, and take a look at all the TED Pri@@ ze win@@ ner@@ s.
So you see, we're nav@@ ig@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it's actually a web@@ , not from pag@@ e-@@ to@@ -@@ pag@@ e, but at a high@@ er level of ab@@ str@@ ac@@ tion.
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by surpri@@ se.
I'm just show@@ ing the New York T@@ imes web@@ s@@ ite here.
So Pi@@ vo@@ t, this applic@@ ation -- I don't want to call it a bro@@ w@@ ser@@ ; it's really not a bro@@ w@@ ser@@ , but you can view we@@ b pag@@ es with it -- and we bring that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technology to every single we@@ b p@@ age like this.
So I can step bac@@ k, po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fic sec@@ tion. Now the reason why this is important is bec@@ a@@ use, by virtu@@ e of just view@@ ing we@@ b pag@@ es in this way, I can look at my entire bro@@ w@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way.
So I can dri@@ ll into what I've done over speci@@ fic time fram@@ es.
H@@ ere, in fact, is the state of all the de@@ mo that I just g@@ av@@ e.
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today.
An@@ d, if I want to step back and look at every@@ thing, I can sl@@ ice and dice my histor@@ y, perhaps by my se@@ arch history --
here, I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ sti@@ c se@@ arch@@ ing, looking for B@@ ing, over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s Pi@@ vo@@ t.
And from thes@@ e, I can dri@@ ll into the we@@ b p@@ age and just la@@ un@@ ch them again.
It's one met@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ pur@@ posed multi@@ ple tim@@ es, and in each case it makes the whole great@@ er than the su@@ m of the parts with the dat@@ a.
So right now, in this world, we think about data as being this cur@@ se.
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ ad.
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in dat@@ a.
What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the we@@ b up@@ side dow@@ n, so that instead of nav@@ ig@@ ating from one thing to the nex@@ t, we get used to the h@@ abi@@ t of being able to go from many things to many things, and then being able to see the patter@@ ns that were other@@ wi@@ se hi@@ d@@ den@@ ?
If we can do that, then instead of being tra@@ pped in dat@@ a, we might actually ex@@ tr@@ act inform@@ ation.
An@@ d, instead of de@@ al@@ ing just with inform@@ ation, we can te@@ ase out knowled@@ g@@ e.
And if we get the knowled@@ g@@ e, then maybe even there's w@@ is@@ dom to be fo@@ und.
So with that, I th@@ ank you.
Every@@ body tal@@ ks about happ@@ in@@ ess these da@@ ys.
I had somebody coun@@ t the number of boo@@ ks with "@@ happ@@ in@@ ess@@ " in the tit@@ le publi@@ shed in the last five years and they gave up after about 4@@ 0, and there were many more.
There is a huge w@@ ave of inter@@ est in happ@@ in@@ ess, am@@ ong research@@ ers.
There is a lot of happ@@ in@@ ess co@@ ach@@ ing.
Every@@ body would like to make people hap@@ pi@@ er.
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work, there are sever@@ al cogn@@ itive tra@@ ps that sort of make it almost im@@ possible to think stra@@ ight about happ@@ in@@ ess.
And my talk today will be mo@@ st@@ ly about these cogn@@ itive tra@@ p@@ s.
This app@@ li@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happ@@ in@@ ess, and it app@@ li@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ s thinking about happ@@ in@@ ess, because it turns out we're just as mess@@ ed up as any@@ body else is.
The first of these tra@@ ps is a rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mi@@ t compl@@ ex@@ ity.
It turns out that the word "@@ happ@@ in@@ ess@@ " is just not a us@@ e@@ ful word any@@ mor@@ e, because we ap@@ ply it to too many different things.
I think there is one particular mean@@ ing to which we might re@@ str@@ ic@@ t it, but by and larg@@ e, this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to ado@@ pt the more complic@@ ated view of what well@@ -@@ being is.
The second tra@@ p is a con@@ fu@@ sion between experience and mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; bas@@ ic@@ ally, it's between being happy in your life, and being happy about your life or happy with your life.
And those are two very different conce@@ pt@@ s, and they're both l@@ um@@ ped in the no@@ tion of happ@@ in@@ ess.
And the third is the foc@@ using illu@@ sion@@ , and it's the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can't think about any circu@@ m@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ec@@ ts well@@ -@@ being without dist@@ ort@@ ing its import@@ ance.
I mean, this is a real cogn@@ itive tra@@ p.
There's just no way of getting it right.
Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ essi@@ on after one of my l@@ ec@@ tu@@ res re@@ port@@ ed a stor@@ y,
and that was a story -- He said he@@ 'd been list@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y, and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ d@@ ing, there was a d@@ read@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching so@@ und.
And then he ad@@ de@@ d, really quite emot@@ ion@@ ally, it ru@@ ined the whole experi@@ ence.
But it h@@ ad@@ n@@ '@@ t.
What it had ru@@ ined were the mem@@ ori@@ es of the experi@@ ence.
He had had the experi@@ ence.
He had had 20 minut@@ es of gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic.
They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ or@@ y@@ ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ in@@ ed, and the mem@@ ory was all that he had go@@ tt@@ en to ke@@ ep@@ .
What this is telling us, really, is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selv@@ es.
There is an experi@@ enc@@ ing self, who lives in the present and know@@ s the present@@ , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ living the pa@@ st, but basically it has only the present@@ .
It's the experi@@ enc@@ ing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es -- you know, when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks, "D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I tou@@ ch you her@@ e?"
And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self, and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore, and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life, and it's the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the quest@@ ion, "@@ How have you been feeling lat@@ el@@ y@@ ?"
or "@@ How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a@@ ?" or something like that.
Th@@ ose are two very different ent@@ iti@@ es, the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happ@@ in@@ ess.
Now, the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er.
And that really start@@ s with a basi@@ c respon@@ se of our mem@@ ori@@ es -- it start@@ s immediat@@ el@@ y.
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stori@@ es.
Our mem@@ ory tell@@ s us stori@@ es, that is, what we get to keep from our experi@@ ences is a story.
And let me beg@@ in with one exampl@@ e.
This is an old stu@@ d@@ y.
Th@@ ose are actu@@ al pati@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proc@@ ed@@ u@@ re.
I won't go into de@@ tail@@ . It's no longer pa@@ in@@ ful these da@@ ys, but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0@@ s.
They were asked to re@@ por@@ t on their pa@@ in every 60 secon@@ ds.
Here are two pati@@ ent@@ s,
those are their recor@@ d@@ ing@@ s.
And you are as@@ k@@ ed, "@@ W@@ ho of them suff@@ ered mor@@ e?"
And it's a very easy quest@@ ion.
C@@ lear@@ ly, P@@ ati@@ ent B suff@@ ered more --
his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was long@@ er, and every min@@ ute of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A h@@ ad, P@@ ati@@ ent B h@@ ad, and more.
But now there is another question@@ : "@@ How much did these pati@@ ents think they suff@@ er@@ ed@@ ?"
And here is a surpri@@ se. The surpri@@ se is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B@@ .
The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ copi@@ es were differ@@ ent, and because a very crit@@ ical part of the story is how it end@@ s. And ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very inspi@@ r@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inc@@ t ... but one of them is dist@@ inc@@ t@@ ly wor@@ se than the other.
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ ak at the very end@@ ;
it's a bad story.
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y, and much later, to@@ o, "@@ How bad was the whole thing, in to@@ tal@@ ?"
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B@@ , in mem@@ or@@ y.
Now this is a direc@@ t con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
F@@ ro@@ m the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self, clear@@ ly, B had a wor@@ se time.
Now, what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A, and we actually ra@@ n clin@@ ical experiment@@ s, and it has been don@@ e, and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ ten@@ d the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ i@@ gg@@ ling it too much.
That will cause the pati@@ ent to suff@@ er, but just a little and much less than befor@@ e.
And if you do that for a couple of minut@@ es, you have made the experi@@ enc@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off@@ , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off@@ , because now you have en@@ dow@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experi@@ ence.
What defin@@ es a stor@@ y?
And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us, and it's also true of the stories that we make up. What defin@@ es a story are chang@@ es, signific@@ ant moment@@ s and end@@ ing@@ s.
En@@ d@@ ings are very, very important and, in this cas@@ e, the ending domin@@ at@@ ed.
Now, the experi@@ enc@@ ing self lives its life continu@@ ous@@ ly.
It has moment@@ s of experi@@ ence, one after the other. And you can as@@ k@@ : What happens to these moment@@ s?
And the answer is really stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ war@@ d@@ :
They are lost for@@ ever@@ . I mean, most of the moment@@ s of our life -- and I c@@ alc@@ ul@@ at@@ ed, you know, the psy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical present is said to be about three secon@@ ds long@@ ; that means that, you know, in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them@@ ; in a mon@@ th, there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don't leave a trac@@ e.
Mo@@ st of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
And y@@ et, some@@ how you get the sense that they should coun@@ t, that what happens during these moment@@ s of experience is our life.
It's the fin@@ ite re@@ source that we're sp@@ ending while we're on this ear@@ th.
And how to spend it would see@@ m to be rel@@ ev@@ ant@@ , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us.
So we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ enc@@ ing self, and they're really quite dist@@ inc@@ t.
The bigg@@ est difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time.
F@@ ro@@ m the point of view of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self, if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation, and the second wee@@ k is just as good as the fir@@ st, then the tw@@ o-@@ wee@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is tw@@ ice as good as the on@@ e-@@ wee@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation.
That's not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
For the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, a tw@@ o-@@ wee@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ wee@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ ori@@ es ad@@ de@@ d.
You have not changed the story.
And in this way, time is actually the crit@@ ical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ i@@ sh@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ;
time has very little imp@@ act on the story.
Now, the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stori@@ es.
It is actually the one that makes decision@@ s bec@@ a@@ use, if you have a pati@@ ent who has h@@ ad, say, two col@@ on@@ os@@ copi@@ es with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to cho@@ os@@ e, then the one that cho@@ o@@ ses is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less b@@ ad, and that's the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en.
The experi@@ enc@@ ing self has no vo@@ ice in this cho@@ ice.
We actually don't cho@@ ose between experi@@ enc@@ es, we cho@@ ose between mem@@ ori@@ es of experi@@ enc@@ es.
And even when we think about the futu@@ re, we don't think of our future norm@@ ally as experi@@ enc@@ es.
We think of our future as ant@@ icip@@ ated mem@@ ori@@ es.
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a ty@@ r@@ ann@@ y of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ gg@@ ing the experi@@ enc@@ ing self through experi@@ ences that the experi@@ enc@@ ing self doesn't ne@@ ed.
I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the cas@@ e; that is, we go on v@@ ac@@ ations, to a very large ext@@ ent, in the serv@@ ice of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
And this is a bit hard to ju@@ sti@@ f@@ y I thin@@ k.
I mean, how much do we consu@@ me our mem@@ ori@@ es?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self.
And when I think about that, I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in An@@ tar@@ c@@ t@@ ica a few years ago, which was clear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I've ever h@@ ad, and I think of it rel@@ ativ@@ ely of@@ ten@@ , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations.
And I probably have consum@@ ed my mem@@ ori@@ es of that thre@@ e-@@ wee@@ k tri@@ p, I would say, for about 25 minut@@ es in the last four years.
Now, if I had ever open@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pictu@@ res in it, I would have spent another hour@@ . Now, that is three wee@@ ks, and that is at most an h@@ our and a hal@@ f@@ . There seems to be a disc@@ re@@ p@@ anc@@ y.
Now, I may be a bit ext@@ rem@@ e, you know, in how little app@@ et@@ ite I have for consum@@ ing mem@@ ori@@ es, but even if you do more of this, there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question@@ :
Why do we put so much we@@ ight on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the we@@ ight that we put on experi@@ enc@@ es?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment@@ .
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation, you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pictu@@ res will be dest@@ ro@@ y@@ ed, and you'll get an am@@ nes@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won't remember any@@ thing.
Now, would you cho@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation@@ ? And if you would cho@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation, there is a con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t between your two selv@@ es, and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t, and it's actually not at all obvi@@ ous, because if you think in terms of time, then you get one answ@@ er,
and if you think in terms of mem@@ ori@@ es, you might get another answ@@ er.
Why do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selv@@ es.
Now, the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happ@@ in@@ ess.
There are really two conce@@ p@@ ts of happ@@ in@@ ess that we can ap@@ pl@@ y, one per self.
So you can as@@ k@@ : How happy is the experi@@ enc@@ ing self@@ ?
And then you would as@@ k@@ : How happy are the moment@@ s in the experi@@ enc@@ ing self@@ 's li@@ fe@@ ?
And they're all -- happ@@ in@@ ess for moment@@ s is a f@@ air@@ ly complic@@ ated proc@@ ess.
What are the emot@@ ions that can be meas@@ ure@@ d@@ ?
An@@ d, by the way, now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self over time.
If you ask for the happ@@ in@@ ess of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, it's a completely different thing.
This is not about how hap@@ pi@@ ly a person liv@@ es.
It is about how s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed or pl@@ eas@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life.
Ver@@ y different no@@ tion.
An@@ y@@ one who doesn't dist@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happ@@ in@@ ess, and I b@@ el@@ ong to a cro@@ w@@ d of students of well@@ -@@ be@@ ing, who@@ 've been mess@@ ing up the study of happ@@ in@@ ess for a long time in preci@@ se@@ ly this way.
The dist@@ inc@@ tion between the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and the s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in re@@ cent years, and there are now ef@@ for@@ ts to meas@@ ure the two separ@@ at@@ el@@ y. The G@@ all@@ up Or@@ g@@ ani@@ z@@ ation has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ enc@@ es,
and there have been other ef@@ for@@ ts along those lin@@ es.
So in re@@ cent years, we have beg@@ un to learn about the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two selv@@ es.
And the main l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have learned is they are really differ@@ ent.
You can know how s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't te@@ ach you much about how hap@@ pi@@ ly they're living their life, and v@@ ice vers@@ a.
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation, the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5@@ .
What that means is if you met some@@ bod@@ y, and you were tol@@ d, "O@@ h his father is six fe@@ et t@@ all@@ ," how much would you know about his he@@ i@@ ght@@ ?
Well, you would know something about his he@@ i@@ ght, but there's a lot of un@@ certa@@ int@@ y.
You have that much un@@ certa@@ int@@ y.
If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten@@ , you have a lot of un@@ certa@@ int@@ y about how happy they are with their experi@@ enc@@ ing self.
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low@@ .
We know something about what contro@@ l@@ s s@@ ati@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the happ@@ in@@ ess self.
We know that money is very important@@ , go@@ als are very important@@ .
We know that happ@@ in@@ ess is ma@@ inly being s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed with people that we like, sp@@ ending time with people that we lik@@ e.
There are other pl@@ eas@@ ure@@ s, but this is domin@@ ant@@ .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ i@@ mi@@ ze the happ@@ in@@ ess of the two selv@@ es, you are going to end up doing very different things.
The botto@@ m line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happ@@ in@@ ess as a sub@@ st@@ it@@ ute for well@@ -@@ be@@ ing.
It is a completely different no@@ tion.
Now, very quick@@ ly, another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happ@@ in@@ ess is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life, and we actually liv@@ e.
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in Californi@@ a, you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answ@@ er.
When you ask that quest@@ ion, you think people must be hap@@ pi@@ er in Californi@@ a i@@ f@@ , say, you live in O@@ hi@@ o.
And what happens is when you think about living in Californi@@ a, you are thinking of the con@@ tras@@ t between Californi@@ a and other plac@@ es, and that cont@@ ra@@ st, say, is in cli@@ mat@@ e.
Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ enc@@ ing self and it's not even very important to the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are.
But now, because the re@@ fl@@ ec@@ tive self is in char@@ g@@ e, you may end up -- some people may end up moving to Californi@@ a.
And it's sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to Californi@@ a in the hope of getting hap@@ pi@@ er.
Well, their experi@@ enc@@ ing self is not going to get hap@@ pi@@ er.
We know that.
But one thing will happen@@ : They will think they are hap@@ pi@@ er, bec@@ a@@ use, when they think about it, they@@ 'll be re@@ min@@ ded of how hor@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o,
and they will feel they made the right decision@@ .
It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well@@ -@@ be@@ ing, and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. I've got a question for you.
Thank you so much.
Now, when we were on the phone a few wee@@ ks ago, you ment@@ ion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting resul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y.
Is that something you can share since you do have a few moment@@ s left now@@ ?
D@@ ani@@ el K@@ ah@@ nem@@ an@@ : Su@@ re.
I think the most interesting resul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ ve@@ y is a number@@ , which we absolutely did not exp@@ ect to fin@@ d.
We found that with re@@ sp@@ ect to the happ@@ in@@ ess of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self.
When we looked at how feel@@ ing@@ s, v@@ ary with in@@ com@@ e. And it turns out that, be@@ low an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year, for Americ@@ ans -- and that's a very large s@@ ample of Americ@@ an@@ s, like 6@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0, so it's a large represent@@ ative s@@ ample -- be@@ low an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year@@ ...
CA: 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0. D@@ K@@ : 6@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0. 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year, people are un@@ happ@@ y, and they get progre@@ ssi@@ v@@ ely un@@ hap@@ pi@@ er the po@@ or@@ er they get@@ . A@@ bo@@ ve that, we get an absolutely fl@@ at lin@@ e.
I mean I've rar@@ ely seen lin@@ es so fl@@ at.
C@@ lear@@ ly, what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happ@@ in@@ ess, but l@@ ack of money certa@@ inly bu@@ ys you mi@@ ser@@ y, and we can meas@@ ure that mi@@ ser@@ y very, very clear@@ ly.
In terms of the other self, the remem@@ ber@@ ing self, you get a different story.
The more money you ear@@ n, the more s@@ ati@@ sfi@@ ed you are.
That does not hold for emot@@ ions.
CA: But D@@ ann@@ y, the whole American en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life, liber@@ t@@ y, the pur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ in@@ ess.
If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ d@@ ing, I mean, it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe ab@@ out, like for example, ta@@ x@@ ation pol@@ ic@@ y and so for@@ th.
Is there any ch@@ ance that polit@@ ici@@ an@@ s, that the country gener@@ ally, would take a fin@@ ding like that seri@@ ously and run public pol@@ ic@@ y based on it?
D@@ K@@ : You know I think that there is recogn@@ ition of the ro@@ le of happ@@ in@@ ess research in public pol@@ ic@@ y.
The recogn@@ ition is going to be s@@ low in the United Stat@@ es, no question about that, but in the U.@@ K@@ .@@ , it is happen@@ ing, and in other countries it is happen@@ ing.
People are recogni@@ z@@ ing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happ@@ in@@ ess when they think of public pol@@ ic@@ y.
It's going to take a wh@@ il@@ e, and people are going to deb@@ ate whether they want to study experience happ@@ in@@ ess, or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation, so we need to have that deb@@ ate f@@ air@@ ly so@@ on.
How to en@@ h@@ ance happ@@ in@@ ess goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think, and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ enc@@ ing self.
This is going to influ@@ ence pol@@ ic@@ y, I think, in years to com@@ e.
In the United Stat@@ es, ef@@ for@@ ts are being made to meas@@ ure the experience happ@@ in@@ ess of the popul@@ ation.
This is going to be, I think, within the next dec@@ ade or tw@@ o, part of national stati@@ stic@@ s.
CA: Well, it seems to me that this is@@ sue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting pol@@ ic@@ y discus@@ sion to tr@@ ack over the next few years.
Thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ic@@ s.
Thank you, D@@ ann@@ y K@@ ah@@ nem@@ an.
I'm going to talk today about energy and cli@@ mat@@ e.
And that might see@@ m a bit surpri@@ sing because my full@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oun@@ d@@ ation is mo@@ st@@ ly about vacc@@ ines and se@@ ed@@ s, about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and de@@ liv@@ er to help the po@@ or@@ est two billion live better liv@@ es.
But energy and climate are ext@@ rem@@ ely important to these people -- in fact, more important than to any@@ one else on the plan@@ et.
The climate getting wor@@ se means that many years, their cro@@ ps won't grow@@ :
There will be too much ra@@ in, not enough ra@@ in,
things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le environ@@ ment simply can't sup@@ port@@ .
And that lead@@ s to star@@ v@@ ation, it lead@@ s to un@@ certa@@ int@@ y, it lead@@ s to un@@ rest@@ .
So, the climate chang@@ es will be terri@@ ble for them.
Al@@ so, the pr@@ ice of energy is very important to them.
In fact, if you could pic@@ k just one thing to low@@ er the pr@@ ice of@@ , to re@@ duce povert@@ y, by far you would pic@@ k ener@@ g@@ y.
Now, the pr@@ ice of energy has come down over time.
Re@@ ally adv@@ anc@@ ed civi@@ liz@@ ation is based on adv@@ anc@@ es in ener@@ g@@ y.
The co@@ al re@@ volu@@ tion fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ut@@ ion,
and, even in the 19@@ 00@@ s we've seen a very rapi@@ d de@@ cl@@ ine in the pr@@ ice of electr@@ ic@@ ity, and that's why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator@@ s, air@@ -@@ condit@@ ion@@ ing, we can make moder@@ n materi@@ als and do so many things.
And so, we're in a wonderful situ@@ ation with electr@@ ic@@ ity in the ric@@ h world.
B@@ ut, as we make it che@@ a@@ per -- and let's go for making it tw@@ ice as che@@ a@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ stra@@ int@@ , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with CO@@ 2@@ .
CO@@ 2 is war@@ ming the plan@@ et, and the equ@@ ation on CO@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ i@@ ght@@ for@@ ward one.
If you su@@ m up the CO@@ 2 that gets em@@ itt@@ ed, that lead@@ s to a temper@@ ature increas@@ e, and that temper@@ ature incre@@ ase lead@@ s to some very neg@@ ative effec@@ t@@ s:
the effec@@ ts on the we@@ a@@ ther@@ ; perhaps wor@@ se, the indi@@ rec@@ t effec@@ ts, in that the natural e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem@@ s can't ad@@ just to these rapi@@ d chang@@ es, and so you get e@@ cos@@ y@@ stem coll@@ ap@@ s@@ es.
Now, the ex@@ act amount of how you ma@@ p from a certain incre@@ ase of CO@@ 2 to what temper@@ ature will be and where the positi@@ ve fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are, there's some un@@ certa@@ int@@ y there, but not very much.
And there's certa@@ inly un@@ certa@@ int@@ y about how bad those effec@@ ts will be, but they will be ext@@ rem@@ ely b@@ ad.
I asked the top scientist@@ s on this sever@@ al tim@@ es@@ : Do we really have to get down to ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o?
Can@@ 't we just c@@ ut it in half or a quar@@ ter@@ ?
And the answer is that until we get ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o, the temper@@ ature will continu@@ e to ris@@ e.
And so that's a big challeng@@ e.
It's very different than saying "@@ We're a tw@@ el@@ ve@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ high tr@@ uc@@ k trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ fo@@ ot bri@@ dg@@ e,
and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under@@ ."
This is something that has to get to z@@ er@@ o.
Now, we put out a lot of carb@@ on di@@ ox@@ i@@ de every year, over 2@@ 6 billion ton@@ s.
For each Americ@@ an, it's about 20 ton@@ s@@ ;
for people in poor countri@@ es, it's less than one t@@ on.
It's an aver@@ age of about five t@@ ons for everyone on the plan@@ et.
An@@ d, some@@ h@@ ow, we have to make chang@@ es that will bring that down to z@@ er@@ o.
It's been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up.
It's only vari@@ ous economic chang@@ es that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all, so we have to go from rapid@@ ly ris@@ ing to f@@ all@@ ing, and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to z@@ er@@ o.
This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tor@@ s,
a little bit of multi@@ plic@@ ation@@ :
So, you've got a thing on the le@@ f@@ t, CO@@ 2, that you want to get to z@@ er@@ o, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the serv@@ ices each person@@ 's using on aver@@ age, the energy on aver@@ age for each serv@@ ice, and the CO@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of ener@@ g@@ y.
So, let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ er@@ o.
Pro@@ bab@@ ly, one of these number@@ s is going to have to get pretty ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o.
Now that's back from high school al@@ ge@@ b@@ ra,
but let's take a loo@@ k.
F@@ ir@@ st, we've got popul@@ ation.
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people.
That's he@@ a@@ ded up to about n@@ ine bill@@ ion.
Now, if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ in@@ es, health car@@ e, re@@ produc@@ tive health serv@@ ic@@ es, we could low@@ er that b@@ y, per@@ hap@@ s, 10 or 15 percent@@ , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3@@ .
The second fac@@ tor is the serv@@ ices we us@@ e.
This en@@ compas@@ ses every@@ thing@@ : the food we e@@ at, clo@@ thing, T@@ V@@ , he@@ at@@ ing.
These are very good thing@@ s: getting ri@@ d of povert@@ y means provi@@ ding these serv@@ ices to almost everyone on the plan@@ et.
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.
In the ric@@ h world, perhaps the top one bill@@ ion, we probably could c@@ ut back and use les@@ s, but every year, this number@@ , on aver@@ age, is going to go up,
and so, over all, that will more than dou@@ ble the serv@@ ices de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed per person@@ .
Here we have a very basi@@ c serv@@ ic@@ e:
Do you have light@@ ing in your house to be able to read your ho@@ me@@ work@@ ? An@@ d, in fact, these kids don@@ '@@ t, so they're going out and read@@ ing their school work under the stre@@ et l@@ amp@@ s.
Now, effici@@ enc@@ y, E, the energy for each serv@@ ice, here fin@@ ally we have some good new@@ s.
We have something that's not going up.
Th@@ rou@@ gh vari@@ ous invent@@ ions and new ways of doing light@@ ing, through different ty@@ p@@ es of car@@ s, different ways of building build@@ ings -- there are a lot of serv@@ ices where you can bring the energy for that serv@@ ice down quite sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally.
Some individu@@ al serv@@ ices even bring it down by 90 percent@@ .
There are other serv@@ ices like how we make fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er, or how we do air tran@@ sport@@ , where the room@@ s for improv@@ ement are far@@ , far les@@ s.
And so, over@@ all here, if we're op@@ ti@@ mist@@ ic, we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to ev@@ en, per@@ hap@@ s, a fac@@ tor of si@@ x@@ .
But for these first three fac@@ tors now, we've gone from 2@@ 6 billion to, at b@@ est@@ , maybe 1@@ 3 billion ton@@ s,
and that just won't c@@ ut it.
So let's look at this four@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of ener@@ g@@ y.
And so the question is@@ : Can you actually get that to z@@ er@@ o?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al, no.
If you bur@@ n natural g@@ as, no.
Al@@ most every way we make electr@@ ic@@ ity today, ex@@ ce@@ pt for the emerg@@ ing ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and nuc@@ lear@@ , put@@ s out CO@@ 2@@ .
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global sc@@ ale, is create a new system.
And so, we need energy mi@@ rac@@ l@@ es.
Now, when I use the ter@@ m "@@ mi@@ rac@@ le@@ ," I don't mean something that's im@@ possi@@ ble.
The micro@@ proc@@ esso@@ r is a mi@@ rac@@ le. The personal computer is a mi@@ rac@@ le.
The Internet and its serv@@ ices are a mi@@ rac@@ le.
So, the people here have part@@ icip@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ rac@@ l@@ es.
U@@ su@@ ally, we don't have a de@@ ad@@ lin@@ e, where you have to get the mi@@ rac@@ le by a certain dat@@ e.
U@@ su@@ ally, you just kind of st@@ and b@@ y, and some come al@@ on@@ g, some don@@ '@@ t.
This is a case where we actually have to dri@@ ve at full spe@@ ed and get a mi@@ rac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine.
Now, I thought, "@@ How could I really cap@@ ture this@@ ?
Is there some kind of natural illu@@ str@@ ation, some de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation that would gra@@ b peopl@@ e's imag@@ in@@ ation her@@ e?"
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ s, and some@@ how people en@@ jo@@ y@@ ed that.
It really got them invol@@ ved in the idea of@@ , you know, there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ s.
So, with ener@@ g@@ y, all I could come up with is this.
I decided that re@@ le@@ as@@ ing fi@@ re@@ fli@@ es would be my cont@@ ribu@@ tion to the environ@@ ment here this year.
So here we have some natural fi@@ re@@ fli@@ es.
I'm told they don't bit@@ e; in fact, they might not even leave that j@@ ar@@ .
Now, there's all sort@@ s of gi@@ m@@ mic@@ k@@ y solut@@ ions like that one, but they don't really ad@@ d up to much.
We need solut@@ ions -- ei@@ ther one or sever@@ al -- that have un@@ believ@@ able scale and un@@ believ@@ able reli@@ abilit@@ y, and, al@@ though there's many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king, I really only see five that can achi@@ eve the big number@@ s.
I've left out ti@@ de, ge@@ other@@ mal@@ , fu@@ sion@@ , bio@@ fu@@ el@@ s.
Th@@ ose may make some cont@@ ribut@@ ion, and if they can do better than I exp@@ ec@@ t, so much the bet@@ ter, but my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these fi@@ ve, and we can't give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ t@@ ing, because they all have signific@@ ant challeng@@ es.
Let's look first at the bur@@ ning fossi@@ l fu@@ el@@ s, ei@@ ther bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning natural g@@ as.
What you need to do there, seems like it might be simpl@@ e, but it's no@@ t, and that's to take all the CO@@ 2, after you've bur@@ ned it, going out the flu@@ e, pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it, create a li@@ qui@@ d, put it some@@ wh@@ ere, and hope it sta@@ ys there.
Now we have some pi@@ lot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level@@ , but getting up to that full percent@@ age, that will be very tr@@ ick@@ y, and agre@@ e@@ ing on where these CO@@ 2 quant@@ ities should be put will be har@@ d,
but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long@@ -@@ ter@@ m issu@@ e.
Wh@@ o@@ 's going to be su@@ re@@ ?
Wh@@ o@@ 's going to guar@@ ant@@ ee something that is liter@@ ally bill@@ ions of times larg@@ er than any type of wa@@ ste you think of in terms of nucle@@ ar or other thing@@ s?
This is a lot of vol@@ um@@ e.
So that's a tou@@ gh one.
N@@ ex@@ t would be nuc@@ lear@@ .
It also has three big problem@@ s:
C@@ ost@@ , particul@@ arly in high@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated countri@@ es, is high@@ ;
the is@@ sue of the sa@@ f@@ et@@ y, really feeling good about nothing could go wron@@ g, that, even though you have these human oper@@ ator@@ s, that the fu@@ el doesn't get used for we@@ ap@@ on@@ s.
And then what do you do with the wa@@ ste@@ ?
An@@ d, al@@ though it's not very larg@@ e, there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that.
People need to feel good about it.
So three very tou@@ gh problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able, and so, should be worked on.
The last three of the fi@@ ve, I've group@@ ed together.
These are what people often re@@ f@@ er to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able sourc@@ es.
And they actually -- al@@ though it's great they don't re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ ag@@ es.
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technologi@@ es is d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically less than a power plant@@ .
This is energy far@@ m@@ ing, so you're talking about many squ@@ are mi@@ l@@ es, thousands of time more area than you think of as a norm@@ al energy plant@@ .
Al@@ so, these are inter@@ m@@ itt@@ ent sourc@@ es.
The s@@ un doesn't sh@@ ine all day, it doesn't sh@@ ine every day, and, li@@ ke@@ w@@ is@@ e, the win@@ d doesn't b@@ low all the time.
And so, if you depen@@ d on these sourc@@ es, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time perio@@ ds that it's not avail@@ able.
So, we've got big cost challeng@@ es here,
we have trans@@ missi@@ on challeng@@ es@@ :
for example, say this energy source is outside your countr@@ y@@ ;
you not only need the technolog@@ y, but you have to deal with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ wh@@ ere.
An@@ d, fin@@ ally, this stor@@ age problem.
An@@ d, to dimension@@ ali@@ ze this, I went through and looked at all the ty@@ p@@ es of batter@@ ies that get made -- for car@@ s, for comput@@ ers, for ph@@ on@@ es, for f@@ las@@ h@@ light@@ s, for everything -- and compar@@ ed that to the amount of electr@@ ical energy the world us@@ es, and what I found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could st@@ ore less than 10 minut@@ es of all the ener@@ g@@ y.
And so, in fact, we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here, something that's going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ ach@@ es we have now.
It's not im@@ possi@@ ble, but it's not a very easy thing.
Now, this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ m@@ itt@@ ent source to be ab@@ ov@@ e, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're us@@ ing.
If you're coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent@@ , you need an incredible mi@@ rac@@ le batter@@ y.
Now, how we're going to go for@@ ward on this -- what's the right appro@@ ach@@ ?
Is it a Man@@ h@@ att@@ an Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ ? What's the thing that can get us ther@@ e?
Well, we need lots of companies working on this, hundre@@ ds.
In each of these five path@@ s, we need at least a h@@ und@@ red people.
And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, "@@ They're cra@@ z@@ y." That's go@@ od.
An@@ d, I think, here in the TED gro@@ up, we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this.
B@@ ill G@@ ro@@ ss has sever@@ al compani@@ es, inclu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ m@@ al technologi@@ es.
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la@@ 's invest@@ ing in do@@ z@@ ens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilit@@ i@@ es, and I'm trying to help back that.
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are bac@@ king a company that, perhaps surpri@@ sing@@ ly, is actually taking the nucle@@ ar appro@@ ach@@ .
There are some innov@@ ations in nuc@@ lear@@ : mo@@ d@@ ul@@ ar@@ , li@@ qui@@ d.
And innov@@ ation really stop@@ ped in this industr@@ y quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surpri@@ s@@ ing.
The idea of Ter@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er is that, instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent@@ , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we deci@@ de@@ d, "@@ Let's bur@@ n the 9@@ 9 percent@@ , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8@@ ." It is kind of a cra@@ z@@ y idea.
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly whether it would work or no@@ t, and so it's through the adv@@ ent of moder@@ n super@@ comput@@ ers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that, y@@ es, with the right materi@@ al@@ 's appro@@ ach@@ , this looks like it would work.
An@@ d, because you're bur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 percent@@ , you have great@@ ly improv@@ ed cost pro@@ fil@@ e.
You actually bur@@ n up the wa@@ st@@ e, and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from to@@ da@@ y's re@@ ac@@ tor@@ s. So, instead of wor@@ r@@ ying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.
It bre@@ ath@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes al@@ on@@ g, so it's kind of like a c@@ and@@ le.
You can see it's a lo@@ g there, often re@@ fer@@ red to as a trav@@ el@@ ing w@@ ave re@@ ac@@ tor@@ .
In terms of fu@@ el, this really sol@@ ves the problem.
I've got a picture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ uc@@ k@@ y.
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver, the 9@@ 9 percent@@ , where they've taken out the part they bur@@ n now, so it's called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um@@ .
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.
An@@ d, simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ ex@@ pensi@@ ve proc@@ ess, you@@ 'd have enough fu@@ el for the entire lif@@ et@@ im@@ e of the rest of the plan@@ et.
So, you know, it's got lots of challeng@@ es a@@ head@@ , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move for@@ war@@ d.
So let's thin@@ k@@ : How should we meas@@ ure our@@ selv@@ es?
What should our re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get@@ , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate.
For 20@@ 5@@ 0, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent re@@ duc@@ tion. That really is very important@@ , that we get there.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countri@@ es, still some ag@@ ric@@ ul@@ tu@@ re,
hop@@ e@@ fully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up forest@@ r@@ y, c@@ ement@@ .
So, to get to that 80 percent@@ , the developed countri@@ es, inclu@@ ding countries like Ch@@ ina, will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their electr@@ ic@@ ity gener@@ ation al@@ together.
So, the other gra@@ de is@@ : A@@ re we de@@ plo@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o-@@ em@@ issi@@ on technolog@@ y,
have we de@@ plo@@ y@@ ed it in all the developed countries
and we're in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ wh@@ er@@ e?
That's su@@ per important@@ .
That's a key el@@ ement of making that re@@ por@@ t car@@ d.
So, bac@@ king up from there, what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ por@@ t car@@ d look lik@@ e?
Well, again, it should have the two element@@ s.
We should go through these effici@@ enc@@ y meas@@ u@@ res to start getting re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s:
The less we em@@ it, the less that su@@ m will be of CO@@ 2, and, ther@@ e@@ for@@ e, the less the temper@@ atu@@ re.
But in some wa@@ ys, the gra@@ de we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tion@@ s, is only equ@@ ally, or maybe even sli@@ ght@@ ly les@@ s, important than the other@@ , which is the piece of innov@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s.
These bre@@ ak@@ throu@@ gh@@ s, we need to move those at full spe@@ ed, and we can meas@@ ure that in terms of compani@@ es, pi@@ lot projec@@ ts, reg@@ ul@@ ator@@ y things that have been chang@@ ed.
There's a lot of great boo@@ ks that have been writ@@ t@@ en about this.
The Al G@@ ore boo@@ k, "O@@ ur Ch@@ o@@ ic@@ e" and the David Mc@@ K@@ ay boo@@ k, "@@ Su@@ stain@@ able E@@ ner@@ gy Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ ot A@@ ir@@ ."
They really go through it and create a fram@@ e@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed bro@@ ad@@ ly, because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this.
There's a lot that has to come together.
So this is a wi@@ sh@@ .
It's a very con@@ cre@@ te w@@ ish that we inv@@ ent this technolog@@ y.
If you gave me only one w@@ ish for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who's presi@@ dent@@ , I could pic@@ k a vacc@@ ine, which is something I lo@@ ve, or I could pic@@ k that this thing that's half the cost with no CO@@ 2 gets invent@@ ed -- this is the w@@ ish I would pic@@ k.
This is the one with the great@@ est imp@@ ac@@ t.
If we don't get this wi@@ sh@@ , the divi@@ sion between the people who think sh@@ ort ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be terri@@ ble, between the U.S. and Ch@@ ina, between poor countries and ri@@ ch, and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far wor@@ se.
So, what do we have to do?
What am I appe@@ al@@ ing to you to step for@@ ward and dri@@ ve@@ ?
We need to go for more research fund@@ ing.
When countries get together in places like C@@ open@@ h@@ ag@@ en, they sh@@ ouldn't just discus@@ s the CO@@ 2@@ .
They should discus@@ s this innov@@ ation ag@@ end@@ a, and you@@ 'd be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ dic@@ ul@@ ously low level@@ s of sp@@ ending on these innov@@ ative appro@@ ach@@ es.
We do need the market inc@@ enti@@ ves -- CO@@ 2 ta@@ x, ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that gets that pr@@ ice sign@@ al out there.
We need to get the mess@@ age out.
We need to have this di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e be a more r@@ ation@@ al, more understand@@ able di@@ al@@ o@@ gu@@ e, inclu@@ ding the ste@@ ps that the government ta@@ k@@ es.
This is an important wi@@ sh@@ , but it is one I think we can achi@@ ev@@ e.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris An@@ der@@ son@@ : Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. So to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er, right --
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of invest@@ ment this is@@ ?
B@@ il G@@ at@@ es@@ : To actually do the softw@@ are, buy the super@@ comput@@ er, hi@@ re all the great scientist@@ s, which we've don@@ e, that's only ten@@ s of mill@@ ions, and even once we test our materi@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ act@@ or to make sure that our materi@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of mill@@ ions.
The tou@@ gh thing is building the pi@@ lot re@@ ac@@ tor@@ ; fin@@ ding the sever@@ al bill@@ ion, fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ ator@@ , the loc@@ ation that will actually build the first one of thes@@ e.
On@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t, if it works as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ se@@ d, then it's just cle@@ ar as day, because the econom@@ ics, the energy den@@ sit@@ y, are so different than nucle@@ ar as we know it.
CA: And so, to understand it right, this invol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the ground almost like a ver@@ t@@ ical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nucle@@ ar fu@@ el, of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um@@ ,
and then the process start@@ s at the top and kind of works dow@@ n@@ ?
B@@ G: That's right. To@@ day, you're always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ l@@ s that can go wron@@ g@@ : that thing where you're open@@ ing it up and moving things in and out,
that's not go@@ od.
So, if you have very che@@ a@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same compl@@ ex@@ iti@@ es.
And it just sit@@ s there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years, and then it's don@@ e.
CA: It's a nucle@@ ar power pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ ste dis@@ pos@@ al solut@@ ion.
B@@ G: Ye@@ ah@@ . Well, what happens with the wa@@ st@@ e, you can let it si@@ t there -- there's a lot less wa@@ ste under this appro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that, and put it into another one and bur@@ n that.
And we start off actually by taking the wa@@ ste that exist@@ s today, that's sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or d@@ ry cas@@ king by re@@ ac@@ tors --
that's our fu@@ el to beg@@ in with@@ .
So, the thing that's been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into our@@ s, and you're re@@ duc@@ ing the volu@@ me of the wa@@ ste quite d@@ ram@@ at@@ ically as you're going through this proc@@ ess.
CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world about the possibilit@@ ies here. Wh@@ ere is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this@@ ?
B@@ G: Well, we hav@@ en't pic@@ ked a particular plac@@ e, and there's all these interesting disc@@ lo@@ sure rul@@ es about anything that's called "@@ nuc@@ lear@@ ," so we've got a lot of interest@@ ,
that people from the company have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a, Indi@@ a, Ch@@ ina --
I've been back seeing the se@@ cre@@ t@@ ary of energy here,
talking about how this f@@ its into the energy ag@@ end@@ a.
So I'm op@@ ti@@ mist@@ ic. You know, the F@@ r@@ enc@@ h and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have done some work.
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been don@@ e.
It's an important adv@@ ance, but it's like a f@@ ast re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , and a lot of countries have built them, so any@@ body who's done a f@@ ast re@@ act@@ or is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets buil@@ t.
CA: So, in your min@@ d, tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ ho@@ od of actually taking something like this li@@ ve@@ ?
B@@ G: Well, we need -- for one of these high@@ -@@ sc@@ ale, elec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that's very che@@ ap@@ , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y.
That's sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environ@@ mental model@@ s have sh@@ own us that we have to me@@ et.
An@@ d, you know, Ter@@ ra@@ P@@ ow@@ er, if things go well -- which is wi@@ sh@@ ing for a lot -- could easi@@ ly me@@ et that.
And there are, fortunat@@ ely now, do@@ z@@ ens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- wh@@ o, li@@ ke@@ w@@ is@@ e, if their science goes well, if the fun@@ ding for their pi@@ lot pl@@ ants goes well, that they can comp@@ ete for this.
And it's best if multi@@ ple succe@@ ed, because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things.
We certa@@ inly need one to succe@@ ed.
CA: In terms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ scale possible game chang@@ es, is this the bigg@@ est that you're aw@@ are of out ther@@ e?
B@@ G: A@@ n energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing.
It would have be@@ en, even without the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ int@@ , but the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much great@@ er.
In the nucle@@ ar spac@@ e, there are other innov@@ ator@@ s.
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the mo@@ d@@ ular people, that's a different appro@@ ach@@ .
There's a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ type re@@ ac@@ tor@@ , which seems a little har@@ d, but maybe they say that about us.
And so, there are different on@@ es, but the be@@ aut@@ y of this is a molec@@ u@@ le of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molec@@ u@@ le of@@ , say, co@@ al, and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ ativ@@ es, which are ess@@ enti@@ ally the radi@@ ation -- the foot@@ pr@@ int and cost@@ , the pot@@ enti@@ al, in terms of eff@@ ect on land and vari@@ ous things, is almost in a clas@@ s of its ow@@ n.
CA: If this doesn't work, then what@@ ?
Do we have to start taking emer@@ gen@@ c@@ y meas@@ u@@ res to try and keep the temper@@ ature of the ear@@ th st@@ ab@@ le@@ ?
B@@ G: If you get into that situ@@ ation, it's like if you've been over@@ -@@ e@@ at@@ ing, and you're about to have a heart att@@ ack@@ :
Then where do you go@@ ? You may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or some@@ thing.
There is a line of research on what's called ge@@ o@@ engine@@ er@@ ing, which are vari@@ ous tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es that would de@@ la@@ y the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.
Now, that's just an in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce pol@@ ic@@ y.
You hope you don't need to do that.
Some people say you sh@@ ouldn't even work on the in@@ su@@ ran@@ ce pol@@ ic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y, that you'll keep e@@ ating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to s@@ ave you.
I'm not sure that's w@@ is@@ e, given the import@@ ance of the problem@@ , but there's now the ge@@ o@@ engine@@ ering discus@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ c@@ k@@ et in case things happen fast@@ er, or this innov@@ ation goes a lot s@@ low@@ er than we exp@@ ect@@ ?
CA: C@@ lim@@ ate s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ic@@ s: If you had a sent@@ ence or two to say to them, how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they're wron@@ g@@ ?
B@@ G: Well, un@@ fortunat@@ ely, the s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ics come in different camp@@ s. The ones who make scienti@@ fic argu@@ ments are very fe@@ w@@ .
A@@ re they saying that there's neg@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back effec@@ ts that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set thing@@ s?
There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a ch@@ ance in a million of those things. The main problem we have here, it's kind of like A@@ ID@@ S.
You make the mi@@ sta@@ ke now, and you pay for it a lot lat@@ er.
And so, when you have all sort@@ s of ur@@ g@@ ent problem@@ s, the idea of taking pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in later,
and a some@@ what un@@ certain pa@@ in thing --
in fact, the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ port@@ , that's not necess@@ ar@@ ily the wor@@ st cas@@ e, and there are people in the ric@@ h world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say, "O@@ K@@ , that isn't that big of a de@@ al@@ ."
The fact is it's that un@@ certain part that should move us to@@ wards this.
But my dre@@ am here is that, if you can make it econom@@ ic, and me@@ et the CO@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ int@@ s, then the s@@ ke@@ pt@@ ics say, "O@@ K@@ , I don't care that it doesn't put out CO@@ 2, I kind of w@@ ish it did put out CO@@ 2, but I gu@@ ess I'll acc@@ ep@@ t it because it's che@@ a@@ per than what's come befor@@ e."
CA: And so, that would be your respon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g argu@@ ment, that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO@@ 2 problem@@ , it's going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of povert@@ y and mal@@ aria and so for@@ th, it's a stupi@@ d wa@@ ste of the Ear@@ th@@ 's resourc@@ es to put money to@@ wards that when there are better things we can do.
B@@ G: Well, the actu@@ al sp@@ ending on the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D piece --
say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that d@@ ram@@ at@@ ic.
It sh@@ ouldn't take away from other things.
The thing you get into big money on, and this, reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agre@@ e, is when you have something that's non-@@ economic and you're trying to f@@ und that --
that, to me, mo@@ st@@ ly is a wa@@ st@@ e.
Un@@ less you're very close and you're just fun@@ ding the learning cur@@ ve and it's going to get very che@@ ap@@ , I believe we should try more things that have a pot@@ ential to be far less ex@@ pensi@@ ve.
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is, "@@ Let's make energy su@@ per ex@@ pensi@@ ve@@ ," then the ric@@ h can af@@ for@@ d that. I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lif@@ est@@ y@@ le.
The disa@@ ster is for that two bill@@ ion.
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chang@@ ed.
H@@ is sh@@ t@@ ick now is, "@@ Why isn't the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D getting more discus@@ se@@ d@@ ?"
He's sti@@ ll@@ , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff@@ , still associ@@ ated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic cam@@ p, but he's realized that's a pretty lon@@ ely cam@@ p, and so, he's making the R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D point@@ .
And so there is a thre@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ propri@@ ate.
The R@@ &@@ amp@@ ;@@ D piec@@ e, it's cra@@ z@@ y how little it's fun@@ de@@ d.
CA: Well B@@ ill@@ , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I spe@@ ak on the be@@ half of most people here to say I really hope your w@@ ish comes tru@@ e. Thank you so much.
B@@ G: Thank you.
I'd like to share with you a dis@@ co@@ very that I made a few months ago while writ@@ ing an art@@ ic@@ le for It@@ ali@@ an Wi@@ re@@ d.
I always keep my thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I'm writ@@ ing any@@ thing, but I'd already fini@@ shed ed@@ it@@ ing the piec@@ e, and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word "@@ dis@@ ab@@ led@@ " to see what I'd fin@@ d.
Let me read you the entr@@ y.
"D@@ is@@ ab@@ l@@ ed, ad@@ jec@@ ti@@ ve@@ : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed, hel@@ pl@@ ess, us@@ el@@ ess, w@@ rec@@ k@@ ed, st@@ all@@ ed, ma@@ im@@ ed, w@@ oun@@ de@@ d, man@@ gl@@ ed, lam@@ e, mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed, run@@ -@@ dow@@ n, wor@@ n@@ -@@ out, we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed, im@@ pot@@ ent, ca@@ str@@ at@@ ed, par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed, hand@@ ic@@ app@@ ed, sen@@ il@@ e, de@@ cre@@ p@@ it, l@@ ai@@ d-@@ up, don@@ e-@@ up, don@@ e-@@ for@@ , don@@ e-@@ in c@@ rac@@ k@@ ed@@ -@@ up, coun@@ t@@ ed@@ -@@ out@@ ; see also h@@ ur@@ t, us@@ el@@ ess and we@@ a@@ k.
An@@ ton@@ y@@ m@@ s, health@@ y, stron@@ g, cap@@ ab@@ le@@ ."
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was lau@@ gh@@ ing, it was so lu@@ dic@@ ro@@ us, but I'd just go@@ tt@@ en past "@@ man@@ gl@@ ed@@ ," and my vo@@ ice bro@@ k@@ e, and I had to stop and coll@@ ect myself from the emot@@ ional sh@@ oc@@ k and imp@@ act that the as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed.
You know, of course, this is my ra@@ gg@@ ed@@ y old thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us
so I'm thinking this must be an anci@@ ent pr@@ int dat@@ e, right?
B@@ ut, in fact, the pr@@ int date was the early 198@@ 0@@ s,
when I would have been starting pri@@ mar@@ y school and form@@ ing an understanding of myself outside the family un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me.
An@@ d, need@@ less to say, th@@ ank G@@ od I wasn't using a thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us back th@@ en.
I mean, from this entr@@ y, it would see@@ m that I was bor@@ n into a world that perce@@ i@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positi@@ ve what@@ so@@ ever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebr@@ ated for the opportun@@ ities and ad@@ vent@@ u@@ res my life has pro@@ cu@@ re@@ d.
So, I immediat@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 online ed@@ it@@ ion, exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vi@@ sion wor@@ th not@@ ing.
Here's the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this entr@@ y.
Un@@ fortunat@@ ely, it's not much bet@@ ter.
I find the last two words under "@@ Ne@@ ar An@@ ton@@ y@@ m@@ s@@ ," particul@@ arly un@@ sett@@ l@@ ing@@ : "@@ wh@@ ol@@ e" and "@@ wh@@ ol@@ es@@ o@@ me@@ ." So, it's not just about the wor@@ ds.
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these wor@@ ds.
It's about the valu@@ es behind the wor@@ ds, and how we con@@ struc@@ t those valu@@ es.
Our language aff@@ ec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people.
In fact, many anci@@ ent societ@@ i@@ es, inclu@@ ding the Gre@@ e@@ ks and the Ro@@ man@@ s, believ@@ ed that to utt@@ er a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so power@@ ful, because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d brought it into exist@@ ence.
So, what real@@ ity do we want to call into exist@@ enc@@ e: a person who is limit@@ ed, or a person who's em@@ power@@ ed@@ ?
B@@ y cas@@ u@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person@@ , a chil@@ d, we might be put@@ ting li@@ ds and ca@@ st@@ ing sh@@ a@@ dow@@ s on their pow@@ er.
W@@ ouldn't we want to open do@@ ors for them inste@@ ad@@ ?
One such person who open@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my child@@ ho@@ od doc@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ st@@ it@@ ute in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ t@@ on, D@@ el@@ aw@@ are.
H@@ is name was D@@ r. Pi@@ zz@@ uti@@ ll@@ o,
an It@@ ali@@ an Americ@@ an, wh@@ ose nam@@ e, appar@@ ent@@ ly, was too difficult for most Americ@@ ans to pron@@ oun@@ ce, so he went by D@@ r. P@@ .
And D@@ r. P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful bo@@ w ti@@ es and had the very perf@@ ect dis@@ positi@@ on to work with children@@ .
I lo@@ ved almost everything about my time spent at this hospit@@ al, with the ex@@ ce@@ ption of my physical ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ ession@@ s.
I had to do what seem@@ ed like in@@ num@@ er@@ able re@@ pet@@ it@@ ions of ex@@ erci@@ ses with these th@@ ic@@ k, el@@ ast@@ ic b@@ ands -- different col@@ or@@ s, you know -- to help build up my le@@ g mus@@ cl@@ es,
and I h@@ ated these b@@ ands more than anything --
I h@@ ated them, had nam@@ es for them. I h@@ ated them.
An@@ d, you know, I was already bar@@ g@@ ain@@ ing, as a five year-@@ old chil@@ d, with D@@ r. P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ erci@@ s@@ es, un@@ success@@ full@@ y, of cour@@ se.
An@@ d, one day, he came in to my s@@ essi@@ on -- ex@@ h@@ au@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ ing, these s@@ ession@@ s --
and he said to me, "@@ W@@ ow@@ . A@@ im@@ e@@ e, you are such a str@@ ong and powerful little girl@@ , I think you're going to bre@@ ak one of those b@@ and@@ s.
When you do bre@@ ak it, I'm going to give you a h@@ und@@ red b@@ uc@@ k@@ s."
Now, of course, this was a simple plo@@ y on D@@ r. P@@ 's part to get me to do the ex@@ erci@@ ses I didn't want to do before the pro@@ sp@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -@@ year-@@ old in the second flo@@ or war@@ d, but what he effec@@ tiv@@ ely did for me was re@@ shap@@ e an aw@@ ful da@@ ily oc@@ curr@@ ence
into a new and pro@@ mi@@ sing experience for me.
And I have to won@@ der today to what ext@@ ent his vi@@ sion and his de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and powerful little gir@@ l shap@@ ed my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently stron@@ g, powerful and ath@@ let@@ ic person well into the futu@@ re.
This is an example of how adul@@ ts in posit@@ ions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a chil@@ d.
B@@ ut, in the pre@@ vi@@ ous inst@@ anc@@ es of those thes@@ a@@ ur@@ us ent@@ ri@@ es, our language isn't allow@@ ing us to evol@@ ve into the real@@ ity that we would all want@@ , the possibilit@@ y of an individu@@ al to see them@@ selves as cap@@ able.
Our language h@@ as@@ n't ca@@ ught up with the chang@@ es in our societ@@ y, many of which have been brought about by technolog@@ y.
Cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly, from a med@@ ical stand@@ point@@ , my leg@@ s, las@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vi@@ sion im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment, tit@@ ani@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ement@@ s for ag@@ ing bo@@ di@@ es that are allow@@ ing people to more fully eng@@ age with their abilit@@ i@@ es, and move bey@@ ond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to ment@@ ion social net@@ working pl@@ at@@ form@@ s allow people to self-@@ identi@@ f@@ y, to cl@@ ai@@ m their own de@@ script@@ ions of them@@ selv@@ es, so they can go ali@@ gn with global group@@ s of their own cho@@ os@@ ing.
So, perhaps technology is re@@ ve@@ al@@ ing more clear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th@@ : that everyone has something rare and powerful to off@@ er our societ@@ y, and that the human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t is our great@@ est ass@@ et.
The human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t, it's an interesting thing, because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sit@@ y, and I'm going to make an ad@@ missi@@ on@@ :
This ph@@ r@@ ase never s@@ at right with me, and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer peopl@@ e's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out wh@@ y.
Im@@ plic@@ it in this ph@@ r@@ ase of "@@ over@@ coming ad@@ ver@@ sit@@ y@@ " is the idea that succ@@ ess, or happ@@ in@@ ess, is about emerg@@ ing on the other side of a challeng@@ ing experience un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experi@@ ence, as if my succ@@ es@@ ses in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circu@@ m@@ nav@@ ig@@ ate the pre@@ sum@@ ed pit@@ f@@ all@@ s of a life with pro@@ s@@ th@@ et@@ ics, or what other people perce@@ i@@ ve as my disa@@ bilit@@ y.
B@@ ut, in fact, we are chang@@ ed. We are mark@@ ed, of course, by a challeng@@ e, whether physic@@ ally, emot@@ ion@@ ally or bo@@ th.
And I'm going to sugg@@ est that this is a good thing.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity isn't an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to re@@ su@@ me living our life.
It's part of our life.
And I ten@@ d to think of it like my sh@@ a@@ dow@@ .
S@@ omet@@ imes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very litt@@ le, but it's always with me.
An@@ d, certa@@ in@@ ly, I'm not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the imp@@ ac@@ t, the we@@ i@@ ght, of a person@@ 's strugg@@ le.
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and chall@@ en@@ ge in life, and it's all very real and rel@@ ative to every single person@@ , but the question isn't whether or not you're going to me@@ et ad@@ ver@@ sit@@ y, but how you're going to me@@ et it.
So, our responsi@@ bilit@@ y is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ ver@@ sit@@ y, but prepar@@ ing them to me@@ et it well.
And we do a dis@@ serv@@ ice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equi@@ pped to ad@@ ap@@ t.
There's an important difference and dist@@ inc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive med@@ ical fact of my being an amp@@ ut@@ ee and the subjec@@ tive societ@@ al op@@ ini@@ on of whether or not I'm dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed.
An@@ d, tru@@ th@@ full@@ y, the only real and con@@ sist@@ ent disa@@ bilit@@ y I've had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that I could be descri@@ bed by those defin@@ it@@ ions.
In our desi@@ re to protec@@ t those we care about by giving them the col@@ d, hard tr@@ ut@@ h about their med@@ ical prog@@ no@@ si@@ s, or, in@@ de@@ ed, a prog@@ no@@ si@@ s on the exp@@ ected quality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first b@@ ric@@ k in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one.
Per@@ haps the exist@@ ing model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it, serv@@ es to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individu@@ al than the path@@ olog@@ y it@@ self.
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person@@ , by not ac@@ knowled@@ g@@ ing their pot@@ enc@@ y, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural strugg@@ le they might hav@@ e.
We are effec@@ tiv@@ ely gra@@ ding some@@ on@@ e's wor@@ th to our commun@@ ity.
So we need to see through the path@@ olog@@ y and into the r@@ ange of human cap@@ abilit@@ y.
An@@ d, most important@@ ly, there's a part@@ ner@@ ship between those perce@@ i@@ ved de@@ fici@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our great@@ est cre@@ ative abilit@@ y.
So it's not about de@@ valu@@ ing, or neg@@ at@@ ing, these more trying times as something we want to av@@ o@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep under the ru@@ g, but instead to find those opportun@@ ities w@@ ra@@ pped in the ad@@ ver@@ sit@@ y.
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is open@@ ing ourselves up to it, embr@@ ac@@ ing it, gra@@ p@@ pl@@ ing with it, to use a w@@ rest@@ ling ter@@ m, maybe even d@@ anc@@ ing with it.
An@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s, if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natur@@ al, con@@ sist@@ ent and us@@ e@@ ful, we're less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it.
This year we celebr@@ ate the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Char@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in, and it was 1@@ 50 years ago, when writ@@ ing about evol@@ ut@@ ion, that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in illu@@ str@@ at@@ ed, I think, a tr@@ ut@@ h about the human char@@ ac@@ ter.
To par@@ ap@@ h@@ r@@ as@@ e: It's not the stron@@ g@@ est of the species that sur@@ viv@@ es, no@@ r is it the most intellig@@ ent that sur@@ viv@@ es@@ ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to chang@@ e.
Con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation.
F@@ ro@@ m D@@ ar@@ win@@ 's work, am@@ on@@ g@@ st other@@ s, we can recogni@@ ze that the human ability to sur@@ vive and fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h is driv@@ en by the strugg@@ le of the human spi@@ ri@@ t through con@@ fl@@ ic@@ t into trans@@ form@@ ation.
So, again, trans@@ form@@ ation, ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ation, is our great@@ est human s@@ kill@@ .
An@@ d, per@@ hap@@ s, until we're test@@ ed, we don't know what we're made of@@ .
Ma@@ ybe that's what ad@@ vers@@ ity gives us@@ : a sense of self, a sense of our own pow@@ er.
So, we can give ourselves a gi@@ f@@ t.
We can re@@ -@@ imagine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just tou@@ gh tim@@ es.
Ma@@ ybe we can see it as chang@@ e.
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we hav@@ en't ad@@ ap@@ ted ourselves to y@@ et.
I think the great@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of norm@@ alc@@ y. Now, who's nor@@ mal@@ ?
There's no nor@@ mal@@ . There's com@@ mon@@ , there's ty@@ pic@@ al. There's no nor@@ mal@@ ,
and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or, be@@ i@@ ge person if they exist@@ ed@@ ?
I don't think so.
If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of achi@@ ev@@ ing norm@@ alc@@ y to one of possibilit@@ y -- or pot@@ enc@@ y, to be even a little bit more dang@@ er@@ ous -- we can re@@ le@@ ase the power of so many more children@@ , and invit@@ e them to eng@@ age their rare and valu@@ able abilit@@ ies with the commun@@ ity.
An@@ th@@ ro@@ pol@@ o@@ gi@@ sts tell us that the one thing we as human@@ s have always re@@ qui@@ red of our community mem@@ ber@@ s is to be of use, to be able to cont@@ ribut@@ e.
There's evid@@ ence that Ne@@ and@@ er@@ th@@ als, 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago, carri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with seri@@ ous physical in@@ j@@ ur@@ y, and perhaps it's because the life experience of sur@@ viv@@ al of these people prov@@ ed of val@@ ue to the commun@@ ity. They didn't view these people as bro@@ ken and us@@ el@@ ess@@ ; they were seen as rare and valu@@ able.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the tow@@ n where I gre@@ w up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a,
and I was stand@@ ing over a bus@@ h@@ el of to@@ mat@@ o@@ es.
It was sum@@ mer@@ ti@@ me@@ : I had sh@@ ort@@ s on.
I hear this gu@@ y, his vo@@ ice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't A@@ im@@ ee M@@ u@@ ll@@ in@@ s." And I turn aro@@ und, and it's this ol@@ der man@@ . I have no idea who he is.
And I said, "@@ I'm sor@@ r@@ y, si@@ r@@ , have we met@@ ? I don't remember me@@ et@@ ing you@@ ." He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember me@@ et@@ ing me.
I mean, when we met I was de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther@@ 's wom@@ b@@ ."
O@@ h, that gu@@ y.
An@@ d, but of course, actually, it did cl@@ ic@@ k.
This man was D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an, a man that I had only known about through my mo@@ ther@@ 's stories of that day, bec@@ a@@ use, of course, ty@@ pic@@ al f@@ ash@@ ion, I arriv@@ ed l@@ ate for my bir@@ th@@ day by two wee@@ ks.
And so my mo@@ ther@@ 's pren@@ at@@ al phys@@ ici@@ an had gone on v@@ ac@@ ation, so the man who de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed me was a compl@@ ete str@@ ang@@ er to my par@@ ent@@ s.
An@@ d, because I was bor@@ n without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ on@@ es, and had fe@@ et turned in, and a few to@@ es in this fo@@ ot and a few to@@ es in that, he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ ang@@ er had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad new@@ s.
He said to me, "I had to give this prog@@ no@@ si@@ s to your parents that you would never wal@@ k, and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bilit@@ y that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ depen@@ d@@ ence, and you've been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce@@ ." The extra@@ ordin@@ ary thing is that he said he had sav@@ ed new@@ sp@@ a@@ per cli@@ pp@@ ings throu@@ gh@@ out my whole child@@ ho@@ od, whether win@@ ning a second gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e,
mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ co@@ ut@@ s, you know, the H@@ al@@ lo@@ we@@ en par@@ a@@ de, win@@ ning my colleg@@ e sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p, or any of my sport@@ s vic@@ t@@ ori@@ es, and he was using it, and integr@@ ating it into teach@@ ing resi@@ dent student@@ s, m@@ ed students from H@@ ah@@ nem@@ an@@ n M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ cho@@ ol and H@@ er@@ sh@@ ey M@@ ed@@ ical S@@ cho@@ ol@@ .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor@@ , the pot@@ ential of the human wi@@ ll@@ .
No prog@@ no@@ si@@ s can ac@@ coun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of some@@ on@@ e's life.
And D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me, he said, "@@ In my experi@@ ence, un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told other@@ w@@ is@@ e, and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of sup@@ port@@ , if left to their own de@@ vic@@ es, a child will achi@@ ev@@ e."
Se@@ e, D@@ r. K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thin@@ k@@ ing.
He underst@@ o@@ od that there's a difference between the med@@ ical con@@ d@@ ition and what someone might do with it.
And there's been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years ol@@ d, if I would have tra@@ ded pro@@ s@@ th@@ et@@ ics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one leg@@ s, I wouldn't have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a secon@@ d.
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of norm@@ alc@@ y back th@@ en.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so su@@ re.
And it's because of the experi@@ ences I've had with them, not in sp@@ ite of the experi@@ ences I've had with them.
And perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I've been ex@@ posed to more people who have open@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cas@@ t sh@@ a@@ dow@@ s on me.
Se@@ e, all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own pow@@ er, and you're off@@ . If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spi@@ ri@@ t is so rece@@ p@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a do@@ or for someone at a cru@@ ci@@ al moment@@ , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sen@@ se.
You're teach@@ ing them to open do@@ ors for them@@ selv@@ es.
In fact, the ex@@ act mean@@ ing of the word "@@ educ@@ ate@@ " comes from the ro@@ ot word "@@ educ@@ e." It means "@@ to bring for@@ th what is wi@@ thin@@ , to bring out pot@@ enti@@ al@@ ."
So again, which pot@@ ential do we want to bring out@@ ?
There was a case study done in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s Brit@@ ain@@ , when they were moving from gram@@ ma@@ r school@@ s to com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ sive school@@ s.
It's called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als. We call it "@@ tr@@ ack@@ ing@@ " here in the Stat@@ es.
It's separ@@ ating students from A, B@@ , C@@ , D and so on.
And the "@@ A student@@ s@@ " get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ric@@ ul@@ um@@ , the best teach@@ ers, et@@ c@@ . Well, they to@@ o@@ k, over a thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th perio@@ d, D@@ -@@ level student@@ s, gave them A@@ '@@ s, told them they were "A@@ '@@ s@@ ," told them they were bri@@ ght,
and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th perio@@ d, they were per@@ form@@ ing at A@@ -@@ level@@ . An@@ d, of course, the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ ak@@ ing, fli@@ p side of this stu@@ d@@ y, is that they took the "@@ A student@@ s@@ " and told them they were "D@@ '@@ s." And that's what happened at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ mon@@ th perio@@ d.
Th@@ ose who were still around in school@@ , b@@ es@@ ide@@ s the people who had dro@@ pped out.
A cru@@ ci@@ al part of this case study was that the teach@@ ers were du@@ ped to@@ o.
The teach@@ ers didn't know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been ma@@ de.
They were simply tol@@ d, "@@ These are the '@@ A@@ -@@ student@@ s@@ ,@@ ' these are the '@@ D@@ -@@ student@@ s@@ .@@ '@@ "
And that's how they went about teach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them.
So, I think that the only true disa@@ bilit@@ y is a cr@@ ush@@ ed spi@@ rit@@ , a spi@@ ri@@ t that's been cr@@ ush@@ ed doesn't have hop@@ e,
it doesn't see be@@ aut@@ y,
it no longer has our natur@@ al, child@@ like curi@@ os@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imag@@ ine.
If inste@@ ad, we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spi@@ ri@@ t to keep hop@@ e, to see be@@ aut@@ y in them@@ selves and other@@ s, to be curi@@ ous and imag@@ in@@ ativ@@ e, then we are tr@@ ul@@ y using our power well.
When a spi@@ ri@@ t has those qual@@ iti@@ es, we are able to create new real@@ ities and new ways of be@@ ing.
I'd like to leave you with a po@@ e@@ m by a four@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ centur@@ y Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my fri@@ en@@ d, J@@ acqu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is told me ab@@ out,
and the po@@ e@@ m is called "The G@@ od W@@ ho On@@ ly K@@ now@@ s F@@ our W@@ ord@@ s@@ "@@ : "@@ E@@ very child has known Go@@ d, not the G@@ od of nam@@ es, not the G@@ od of don@@ '@@ ts, but the G@@ od who only know@@ s four words and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them, say@@ ing, '@@ Come d@@ ance with me. Com@@ e, d@@ ance with me. Com@@ e, d@@ ance with me@@ .@@ '@@ "
Thank you.
